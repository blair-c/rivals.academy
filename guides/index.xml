Hitfall Kills Onstage Copied link! While onstage, you have access to strong attacks, and coupled with Dair&amp;rsquo;s hefty hitstun, you have access to stable setups into your strongs.
Dair &amp;gt; Fstrong Copied link! While many of Ori&amp;rsquo;s kill setups require DI reads or guessing, Dair &amp;gt; Fstrong can be done on reaction.</description></item><item><title>How to Use Orcane's Forward Air</title><link>https://rivals.academy/guides/how-to-use-orcane-fair/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivals.academy/guides/how-to-use-orcane-fair/</guid><description>Orcane&amp;rsquo;s Fair is a bit like a special move, with a lot of unique properties. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about how to use it. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about everything from the absolute basics to some more in-depth stuff. Let&amp;rsquo;s get into it.
Basic Control Copied link! First of all, it&amp;rsquo;s very important that you input Fair with the right control stick. This gives you maximum control over your aerial drift.</description></item><item><title>Invincible Ledgedash</title><link>https://rivals.academy/guides/invincible-ledgedash/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivals.academy/guides/invincible-ledgedash/</guid><description>Why Ledgedash? Copied link! First, what is a ledgedash? Ledgedashing is teching the corner of the stage wall after a hit and quickly wavelanding onto stage while you still have invincibility. Ledgedashing can be a useful tool for recovery and a possible reversal when being edgeguarded, and we&amp;rsquo;ve seen it become increasingly prominent in Rivals&amp;rsquo; meta over the past few years.

With that being said, let&amp;rsquo;s begin!
Clone &amp;gt; Up Strong Copied link! Up Strong 2 is Forsburn&amp;rsquo;s strongest grounded move, but landing it for a kill can be inconsistent at times.</description></item><item><title>Shine > Up Strong</title><link>https://rivals.academy/guides/shine-upstrong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivals.academy/guides/shine-upstrong/</guid><description>Zetterburn&amp;rsquo;s Shine &amp;gt; Up Strong is one of the strongest kill options in the game as it is almost always applicable for a parry punish and is a follow up off of a frame 2 move (Shine) that can also be used to whiff punish effectively. Performed correctly, it&amp;rsquo;s a true confirm on the entire cast well into Up Strong kill %.

Horzontal Range Copied link! Down Strong allows you to cover a range of distances by preserving some of your momentum as you start the move, as well as allowing you to drift slightly in either direction during your rise into the air.</description></item></channel></rss>
