Copied link! First, what is a ledgedash? Ledgedashing is teching the corner of the stage wall after a hit and quickly wavelanding onto stage while you still have invincibility. Ledgedashing can be a useful tool for recovery and a possible reversal when being edgeguarded, and we&amp;rsquo;ve seen it become increasingly prominent in Rivals&amp;rsquo; meta over the past few years.
