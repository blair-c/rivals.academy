The game is generally pretty well balanced and anybody can succeed with any character.

<span class=copied>Copied to clipboard</span></h2><p>As the prince of the Fire Empire, Zetterburn serves his militant nation as a fierce warrior with pride, ferocity, and absolute loyalty.</p><p>On the macro scale, Zetterburn is this game’s manifestation of the Space Animal archetype. Spacie players from games like Melee and Project M will find a lot of familiar moves in Zetterburn’s arsenal.</p><video controls loop muted preload>

video.</video><p>All of Zetterburn’s Strong Attacks are amplified when hitting a flaming opponent, causing these already strong moves to be able to take stocks frighteningly early. He’s well-equipped with ways to set up into these Strongs as well, so this power is always easy to tap into at a moment’s notice.</p><video controls loop muted preload>

He’s also considered to be a rather straightforward character: he doesn’t really have any obtuse gimmicks to learn and his moveset and gameplan are relatively orthodox, making Zetterburn a popular choice for newcomers.</p><video controls loop muted preload>

Zetterburn can often find himself in a position where he gets stuck in a loop trying to make it back onto the stage from the edge, especially in certain matchups.</p><video controls loop muted preload>

<span class=copied>Copied to clipboard</span></h2><p>Orcane is a trickster with a reputation for causing trouble. While he&rsquo;s publicly denounced by The Water Merchants, he is often called to their aide to carry out their more back-alley affairs.</p><p>His moveset reflects his trickster nature, as he gets a lot of mileage out of conditioning, laying traps, and opportunistic play. His normals have a great combo of good frame data and large hitboxes, allowing him to strike with confidence when an opening presents itself. Complementing this is some of the most readily accessible kill power in the game.</p><video controls loop muted preload>

video.</video><p>He’s able to make these openings with the help of his puddles. Most of his special moves will put a puddle on the ground, which Orcane can use in many ways. He can pop a puddle into a flurry of bubbles which can trap the opponent and grant Orcane a followup, he can consume puddles to dramatically increase the range and damage of his Strong Attacks and Side Special, and he uses puddle for recovery by using Up Special to teleport to it.</p><video controls loop muted preload>

His long-range presence relies on puddles, which must be planted in advance, and usage of puddles in this way must be balanced with the utility they can offer elsewhere.</p><video controls loop muted preload>

They excel at forcing their opponent into bad situations in order to close out games, which is important given that their raw killpower is somewhat mediocre. However, once the enemy is where Ori wants them, they’ll find themselves being carried into the blastzone or falling victim to a devastating setup.</p><video controls loop muted preload>
