&lt;p>While onstage, you have access to strong attacks, and coupled with Dair&amp;rsquo;s hefty hitstun, you have access to stable setups into your strongs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While many of Ori&amp;rsquo;s kill setups require DI reads or guessing, Dair &amp;gt; Fstrong can be done on reaction. With Dair&amp;rsquo;s heavy hitstun, you have the freedom of being able to follow DI without any problems.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Even on extreme levels of DI, SDI and drift, you can still catch them with an Fstrong, although at this level of DI the timing is very tight, and closer to a read than an actual setup.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Speaking of reads, Dair &amp;gt; Up Strong is exactly that, a read that can net you kill earlier than an Fstrong, at the cost of certainty.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>However, due to the laggy nature of Up Strong, you will have to pick a single option to cover, which overall makes this option potent, but somewhat unreliable.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Considerations for the following setups:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>As with all moves fastfell offstage, you will be falling incredibly quick, don’t try to hit these setups if you are too close to the bottom blastzone, which will result in an SD.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I will be detailing these setups on DI in. If your opponent is DIing Dair out, you must follow them accordingly, or you will SD.&lt;/li>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While seemingly being a little extra, Dair &amp;gt; Bair sometimes gives that little boost of % needed to get a kill off the side blastzone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The scariest, riskiest, most satisfying thing to hit: Dair &amp;gt; Bash. This setup is the pinnacle of early kills, closing stocks at ridiculously low %s.&lt;/p>

video.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>An aspect unique to this setup is your position when going for the initial Dair. For lower %s, you should always aim to be above your opponent when landing the Dair, as being too low or inside of them will cause you to plummet below them, into an SD. At higher %s, you have flexibility as to where your initial Dair lands, but if possible, it’s the best option to always try to hit the Dair above. This setup will start to connect around 60% on the entire cast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nature of Ori revolves around having less set in stone kill confirms, so while fishing for them is a good way to lose stocks, having access to this list of consistent kill confirms out of Dair is still key to keep in mind.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On stages where the bottom blastzone is &lt;strong>412 pixels&lt;/strong> deep or larger, you can &lt;strong>runoff Dair&lt;/strong> and still have the means to make it back to stage.
The stages you can do this on are, in order of easiest to hardest to make it back:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fire Capital&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Endless Abyss&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Troupple Pond&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Air Armada*&lt;/li>

&lt;p>If you add in a &lt;strong>shorthop&lt;/strong> offstage before the Dair, you can survive on stages with &lt;strong>396 pixels&lt;/strong> deep or larger.

&lt;p>Up Tilt is a move with relatively weak knockback at its base, but built-up heat can be expended to empower the move. Up Tilt’s knockback increases linearly based on how much heat is expended, from 7 base + 60 scaling with no heat to 9 base + 90 scaling at overheat, and its endlag on hit from 10 frames with no heat to 20 frames at overheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Up Tilt is a move with a multitude of mixups, but even without them the move is still very powerful. Overheat Up Tilt can kill confirm into Missile &amp;gt; Nair or almost any of Elli’s other deadly combos, or just outright kill. However, there are certain percent windows (which vary greatly depending on stage, character, and positioning) where a high heat Up Tilt may not be easy to convert off of while not killing outright either, and this is where our mixups become especially useful.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By holding the parry button as you release the opponent, you can retain all heat, and consequently lower the move’s knockback and endlag significantly (depending on how much heat you currently have). &lt;strong>This is a completely unreactable DI mixup.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Once your opponent hits mid percents, they typically have no choice but to DI in on high heat Up Tilt at ledge unless they make a hard read on your heat retain, which is a risk immensely stacked in your favour (especially since if they read you correctly and DI out, they’re still offstage versus one of the best edgeguarders in the game). As such, it ends up being very easy to confirm heat retain Up Tilt into an overheat strong attack, and depending on the percent any of the three strongs can be applied. This can net you kills in situations where you may not otherwise be able to secure the stock.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Additionally, Up Tilt can be turned around by inputting the opposite direction before the opponent is swallowed by Elli’s mech. &lt;strong>This is a reactable DI mixup, with a 23 frame animation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not nearly as potent a mixup, turning around your Up Tilt to send the opponent to the opposite side of the stage can also function as a lethal DI check and keep your opponent on their toes.&lt;/p>

Combined with her unique double jump momentum and the ability to double jump cancel with her aerials, this allows her to move through the air in unorthodox ways. There are a couple variations of this technique to learn, so let’s take look at how each of these are performed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="midair" class="heading">

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first of these is a midair Gravity Jump that can be performed anytime you are able to fastfall. For those of you who don’t know, fastfalling in Rivals of Aether is not an instant action and is delayed until 4 frames after the input is made. Since we need to begin our double jump on the same frame that our fastfall begins, to perform the technique in midair we will need to input our double jump exactly 4 frames after the fastfall input. If done correctly, Absa will begin falling towards the ground with reduced speed and more horizontal control. As this variation requires a frame perfect input, the reliability of the technique is questionable, however the movement it provides has some obvious benefits.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you’d prefer to avoid a frame perfect input however, then you’re in luck! Due to a mechanic related to fastfalls from platform drops, the Gravity Jump is far more easily performed while standing on a platform. Anytime you platform drop you will begin an 8 frame timer. If you are holding down on the last frame of this timer your character will fastfall instantly. By using this timer to force a fastfall, the Gravity Jump becomes far easier to perform, simply drop from the platform and keep down held while you input your double jump. You may input the double jump anytime before the plat-drop timer ends, so long as you are holding down on the 8th frame of the timer, making this version consistent to perform and much easier to use fluidly in your movement. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that beginning your double jump earlier into the timer will cause your momentum in the air to stall slightly more before you start to fall, as the fastfall will always begin on the 8th frame of airtime.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There is one more notable property of the Gravity Jump to learn. Absa’s double jump normally begins by accelerating downwards slightly before quickly rising into the air. As her Gravity Jump reverses this momentum, the technique will cause her to accelerate upwards slightly before travelling downwards. When combined with the delayed fastfall of a platform drop Gravity Jump, you are able to slow your descent enough that you can reliably hit characters standing beside you on a platform from beneath with an instantaneous Up Air before you reach the ground. This can be performed even from some of the lowest platforms in the game. As your Up Air has the same knockback as your Up Strong, this is an extremely powerful mix-up to have at your disposal. Remember to hold the jump button during your aerial to preserve your momentum, as releasing it will instead perform a double jump cancel and will cause you to fall and land before your Up Air becomes active.&lt;/p>

&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our last important lesson is that Absa’s Gravity Jump is also able to restore her double jump, allowing you to use the technique without sacrificing the use of your double jump in the processs. This can allow you to move in unexpected ways and can extend your horizontal reach through the air quite significantly without the risk of being stuck off-stage without one of your most valuable resources. The double jump will be restored 7 frames into the animation, but only if your vertical speed is moving downwards fast enough. This allows you to cancel the animation and instantly input any of your aerial attacks whilst still refreshing your jump, however, moves such as your Up Special and Neutral Special will halt your momentum and prevent it from being restored. This double jump refresh applies to all variations of the Gravity Jump that have been discussed so far, and since you can perform the Gravity Jump in midair this even allows you to refresh your double jump multiple times if performed correctly!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Try testing out the Gravity Jump on stages with different platform layouts, practicing your movement and your aerial control during your attacks. There’s a lot of room for experimentation in how you can use it with Absa’s unique double jump mechanics, but most importantly it’s also pretty fun to play with as well!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Use Orcane's Forward Air</title><link>https://rivals.academy/lectures/how-to-use-orcane-fair/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivals.academy/lectures/how-to-use-orcane-fair/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Orcane&amp;rsquo;s Fair is a bit like a special move, with a lot of unique properties. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about how to use it. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about everything from the absolute basics to some more in-depth stuff. Let&amp;rsquo;s get into it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First of all, it&amp;rsquo;s very important that you input Fair with the right control stick. This gives you maximum control over your aerial drift. If you use keyboard controls, you can bind left/right RS buttons for the same effect.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Orcane&amp;rsquo;s Fair is also great for recovering. You can use it to stall aerially offstage because you don&amp;rsquo;t lose too much height when you use it, but you can also use it to quickly propel yourself back to stage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This technique is a little niche. I call it &amp;ldquo;The 1Bub.&amp;rdquo; This is where you autocancel your Forward Air so that only one tick of bubbles appears. You can tell that you did it right if you don&amp;rsquo;t hear a sound effect, and you will only see two bubbles appear.&lt;/p>

With that being said, let&amp;rsquo;s begin!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Up Strong 2 is Forsburn&amp;rsquo;s strongest grounded move, but landing it for a kill can be inconsistent at times. Loathe though I am to admit it, there is some truth to the common Forsburn joke “Upcape is RNG” since in most cases the opponent can easily fall out of the first hit of Up Strong by DIing in front of Forsburn (away from the dagger). However, this Clone &amp;gt; Up Strong setup is fairly effective at mixing up the opponent&amp;rsquo;s DI to make the second hit of Up Strong connect. Here is the setup in action:&lt;/p>

video.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>The key to this setup is allowing the clone to move to the other side of your opponent and then popping the opponent towards yourself. Usually when I execute this setup, it&amp;rsquo;s after I have hit the opponent to the edge and they&amp;rsquo;re coming back onstage. When the clone hits them, they&amp;rsquo;re almost always holding in to some degree because they want to get onstage/closer to center stage — if you are facing your opponent with Up Strong then this means they will conveniently be DIing &lt;em>towards&lt;/em> the dagger as shown from the DI lines here:&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>This DI mixup is most effective near the edge when the opponent wants to get back onstage. However, even in the middle of the stage this setup is still difficult to DI correctly since the opponent often isn&amp;rsquo;t prepared to correctly DI both the clone &lt;em>and&lt;/em> the Up Strong. Additionally, the first/back hitbox of Upcape is a true link into the dagger hit so if you&amp;rsquo;re fortunate enough for the clone pop to send the opponent into that hitbox then you&amp;rsquo;ve got an easy confirm.&lt;/p>

It takes some experimentation to get under your belt, but is fairly easy to execute once learned and is very rewarding at low risk of overextending. Upcape may be RNG (personally I still don&amp;rsquo;t buy it), but this setup definitely helps to load it in your favor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sure that most Forsburns do this inadvertently at times, but clone walling is something that I have implemented in my play against certain characters that like to mindlessly throw out or approach with projectiles. Clone walling is simply cloning away from your opponent (so the clone is closer to your opponent) and then running in behind it with a move. If you know that the opponent likes to throw out projectiles willy nilly, this is a great way to approach them with relative safety and catch them by surprise or catch them in their endlag.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this clip, Ranno began the game by charging needles and fired them when he saw me approaching. With clone walling, however, I was able to catch him by surprise and approach unhindered by the projectiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tech won&amp;rsquo;t do your taxes for you, and it&amp;rsquo;s not going to work consistently once your opponent figures out what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, but in a game where each neutral win can lead to a precious combo or stock, this is a great mixup from simply parrying the projectile that can get you that extra neutral win. Below is a particularly deceptive example of this tech — this one worked well because the clone spawned behind my smoke, so I had an additional element of surprise when clone walling in this situation, and it got me the stock.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Projectiles this works against:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Zetterburn&amp;rsquo;s fireball&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Absa&amp;rsquo;s Ftilt2&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Elliana&amp;rsquo;s missiles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ori&amp;rsquo;s light orb&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ranno&amp;rsquo;s needles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Clone walling can also be used defensively against Shovel Knight&amp;rsquo;s SideB and Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s DownB since they have hit detection and stop as soon as they hit something. In both of these cases, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly difficult to convert the clone wall into a neutral win, but it at least prevents you from getting hit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Kragg&amp;rsquo;s rock is not on the list above because it stays active until it touches the ground after hitting the clone. Clone walling can stop the rock from hitting you on the initial throw, but be careful about running in directly behind the clone lest you get hit while the rock is still falling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and have an average (at best) reaction time and consistently tech-chasing is difficult, then this technique is for you. Forsburn has a lot of bread and butter combos to get the opponent from low to mid percents, but the opponent will typically start getting more chances to DI out and tech to escape your combos as they get to mid percents. Since the clone&amp;rsquo;s AI is programmed to always follow the opponent (unless you&amp;rsquo;re a maniac and press the Special button again), it has an essentially perfect reaction time and can do the tech-chasing for you:&lt;/p>

video.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>In this case the clone didn&amp;rsquo;t have to move since the opponent rolled in, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to see that the clone would&amp;rsquo;ve been able to chase on any DI and tech option for a reliable follow-up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes the opponent will be able to DI hard out and escape the combo if they have enough room on the stage, but the clone charging at them will still help you press your advantage state despite not having a guaranteed follow-up.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Note: This technique should only be used at mid percents. At low percents, you should be going for different combo options and likely won&amp;rsquo;t have time to get the clone out mid-combo. At high percents, the opponent will be sent offstage or too far away for the clone to be meaningful.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As we all know, ledgeboosting is an essential movement option for Forsburn. The extra speed gained from ledgeboosting as opposed to simply running or wavedashing is very significant. Giving this boost to your clones by spawning them right next to the edge of a platform so that they boost off is a nice way to give a slight mixup to what is ordinarily a rather straightforward AI.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Many platforms have a short enough width that your clones will ledgeboost automatically, but learning to space your clones when on platforms so that they ledgeboost is a good habit to get into to give your opponents as little time to react as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, if the opponent is detected to be higher on the stage than the clone, it will perform a ledgeboosted jump.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Making your clone extra speedy in this way will help keep your opponent on their toes because it looks more life-like and it gives them less time to react than a regular clone running along the ground. See non-boosted clone for comparison:&lt;/p>

I will preface this guide by stating my intentions are not to provide optimal combos, but rather provide a general understanding of options that are available to you. An optimal bubble combo is one that follows and reacts to the opponent&amp;rsquo;s bubble drift, so don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to be creative with the combos I have listed below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fair Spike &amp;gt; Up Air 1 &amp;gt; Bair&lt;/strong> (27%)&lt;br>
Fair Spike &amp;gt; Up Air 1 (Hitfall the first hit of Up Air) &amp;gt; Bair provides solid damage and has the added benefit of being a DI mixup. Depending on how you position yourself after the Up Air 1, you can either opt for sweetspot Bair and hopefully catch your opponent holding out or the Reverse Hit for the possibility of a combo extender.&lt;/p>

Compared to the combos listed above, this will be more towards the harder end of &amp;ldquo;basic&amp;rdquo;; borderline intermediate. Instead of going for Fair, as shown in Basic Combo 3, you can instead alter the route into a string of Up Air 1s leading into a Bair, Nair, or Fair finisher. Do remember that the opponent is able to escape Up Air 1 strings with either an airdodge or a Jump.&lt;/p>

The classic go-to kill option that does its job very well in a multitude of situations. Please note that during kill range, this combo is very much avoidable by Di-ing down then immediately up, but the difficulty of such DI allows it to land far more often then it should.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When characters leave a platform, they will carry some amount of speed with them into the air depending on their status and properties. Characters who are faster on the ground than in the air have their speed capped upon leaving mostly due to their &amp;ldquo;Max Horizontal Jump Speed&amp;rdquo; stat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where &lt;strong>boosting&lt;/strong> comes in, a catch-all term for techniques involving leaving a platform during initial dash that enables certain characters to bypass those speed caps. This can be used to enable highly effective burst movement around platforms, shown below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Boosting is split up into four techniques: platboost, ledgeboost, platmoost, and ledgemoost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two subcategories of these techniques are &lt;strong>platboosting&lt;/strong> vs. &lt;strong>ledgeboosting&lt;/strong>. These refer to whether you leave the platform by dropping through with a platform drop (&lt;strong>platboost&lt;/strong>) or by dashing off the edge (&lt;strong>ledgeboost&lt;/strong>) during your initial dash. Note that the duration of initial dashes varies across the cast from 8 to 16 frames, with the longer dashes giving you a larger window for performing the tech. These techniques will &lt;em>not&lt;/em> work if you enter the run animation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second distinction is &lt;strong>boosting&lt;/strong> vs. &lt;strong>moosting&lt;/strong>. &lt;strong>Boost&lt;/strong> refers to performing the tech via an initial dash. &lt;strong>Moost&lt;/strong> refers to performing the tech via a moonwalk, which has similar behavior to initial dash, but at max speed is 20% faster than initial dash for all characters (and you’ll be traveling backwards).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shine &amp;gt; Up Strong is performed by using a Shine from an initial dash so that you slide forward while the Shine connects. From this, jump cancel out of the Shine, then use that to do a jump canceled Up Strong during your jump squat.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are two commons issues many have. The first is fireballing instead of getting the sliding shine. If this happens, you are holding the direction on your stick for too long which causes a side input to be read. Make sure that the stick returns to a neutral position to avoid those costly fireballs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second issue is an Up Special in place. This is caused by pressing jump too soon in the sequence which causes your Shine + Up Strong to be read as an Up Special since you are pressing special and up at the same time. Make sure that you are making your inputs in the order of Dash &amp;gt; Shine &amp;gt; Jump &amp;gt; Up Strong, and return to practicing each part individually if you find yourself struggling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Down Strong allows you to cover a range of distances by preserving some of your momentum as you start the move, as well as allowing you to drift slightly in either direction during your rise into the air. The below clip demonstrates how different methods of movement allow you to manipulate the horizontal distance of your leap. Mail of Momentum (MoM) changes the properties of your wavedash and run turnaround significantly, having it equipped will change how you can use the move to your advantage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shovel Knight’s vertical leap can be increased by holding up during Down Strong’s startup. If you are holding up on the 6th frame of startup you’ll be boosted upwards slightly, allowing you to land on standard height platforms from the stage floor. Although a slightly slower kill option than Up Strong from directly beneath a platform, this option is relevant on almost every stage in the game and can cover a wider area more reliably if you are approaching from a short distance away. In combination with some of the longer distance leaps at your disposal you can use this as a powerful aerial approach, with the strong landing hitboxes becoming active from frame 18 onwards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charging Down Strong will increase Shovel Knight’s height for 1 extra frame before his vertical position is locked in. Although not terribly notable, in combination with a boosted jump this allows you to reach the platforms on Abyssal Gates from the ground. The charge window begins on frame 17 of the attack, with only 1 frame of charge is required to increase the height. Shovel Knight will hover at this height during the full duration of the charge window (maximum of 60 frames). During the charge window you also gain the ability to also alter your horizontal position slightly during the charge by inputting left or right.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dynamo Mail allows Shovel Knight to perform any of his strong attacks in the air after a successful Down Air, providing him an aura which lasts for 600 frames, but is removed on hit. Combined with Down Strong’s vertical leap, this provides Shovel Knight the ability to super-jump with the attack when buffered during the jump-squat frames. You’ll notice your peak height will increase on either a short hop or full hop, with the full hop variation launching you much higher into the air. This can allow Shovel Knight to threaten even the highest platforms from a grounded position, impacting your attack options in neutral, the amount of space you can cover against a recovering opponent or even as a tech chase option.&lt;/p>

Wavebouncing/reversing Dspecial alone is a great way to mix up your landings and platform movement, but the flip makes you that much more mobile and slippery (and cool).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The inputs consist firstly of a Down Special followed by a press of the dodge button to cancel into a flip, but what matters the most is how you turn yourself around with the analog stick. There are a plethora of methods and personal preferences to do this, but my favorite and the easiest way is to perform a quarter circle. Starting with your analog stick facing diagonally downwards towards whatever ledge you wish to slide off of, quickly press dodge to perform the flip cancel and roll your analog stick 90 degrees to the other side, pointed diagonally downwards towards where you started the flip.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Learning the flip this way allows for the pityflip to be initiated whether facing towards or away from ledge. While facing towards, there is no need to start diagonally downwards, as you can just hold down and input the flip to launch the correct way. However when facing away from the stage, the diagonal turns you around first so that you launch towards the edge, while the quarter circle will turn you back around. The reason l say to practice with the diagonal anyways is to build muscle memory and become comfortable performing the tech regardless of which way you are facing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Nuanced control of your aerial drift, and/or a fastfall input just above ledge can both help you hit the slideoff correctly if the spacing of the flip wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Spirit Tree and Air Armada are the best stages to practice this on, as you can bounce between the plats with ease. Practice going from one platform to another, but also perform the quarter circles to return to the platform you just came from (flip off of the ones you are facing away from) to get comfortable going both directions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recovering with pityflip, you should be looking to bait an attack from your opponent while you clip the stage and quickly slide off after regaining all of your resources. This allows for an almost immediate reversal, as you have back your double jump, walljump, and air dodge, but you are still in a vulnerable position offstage. As stated before, this option is fundamentally a &lt;strong>mixup&lt;/strong>, as when predicted it can be very easily punished and is not worth it. It is however quite difficult to react to when done right, especially if your opponent isn’t ready for it, so if you use it wisely, it can save you from a lot of hassle recovering with Up B and Down B on repeat.&lt;/p>

All characters have both default landing lag values and specific landing lag values should you land during an aerial. The standard default landing lag value is 4 frames, with the six heavy characters (Kragg, Etalus, Sylvanos, Elliana, Hodan, and Olympia) having an increased default value of 6 frames. While the landing lag mechanic is designed to slow you down to some degree, you’ll find that there are several ways that you can avoid the full extent of your landing lag. Here are some of things that you need to know if you want to speed up your play.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Similar to how the endlag of most of your normal attacks works, landing lag has interactions with the hit cancelling (or whiff lag) mechanic. On hitting your opponent your landing lag is reduced by one third, allowing you to more effectively combo your hits without any extra input required. If this reduced value on hit is lower than your default landing lag it will increase to the default value instead.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If your aerial successfully connects with another character or object before you interrupt it by landing you will be able to cancel the last 5 frames of your aerial’s landing lag into jumpsquat, allowing you to become airborne on the same frame you would normally be actionable on the ground. Although this mechanic also works with your default landing lag, the ability to perform multiple aerials in quick succession or cancel your landing into a faster wavedash approach is invaluable in any character’s kit. Learning to hitfall your aerials and cancel your landing lag into jumpsquat is arguably one of the most important skills to learn if you want to improve.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>It’s worth noting that heavy characters (Kragg, Etalus, Sylvanos, Elliana, Hodan, Olympia) arguably benefit more from being able to cancel their landing lag into jumpsquat. Since heavy characters&amp;rsquo; default landing lag value is 6, they will be unable to cancel the entirety of the landing lag into jumpsquat, only the last 5 frames. Despite this, if an aerial’s on hit landing lag value for a heavy character is 6 frames or less it will be possible to cancel the full amount into jumpsquat, effectively allowing you to act 1 frame sooner than what should be possible. The below example of Kragg’s neutral air, a move with 6 frames of landing on hit, when cancelled into jumpsquat on the first frame of landing lag is fully actionable in the air on frame 6.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As you can cancel your landing lag into jumpsquat, you are also effectively able to cancel it into other actions as well. There are obvious movement benefits of being able to wavedash out of your landing lag, which can then subsequently be cancelled into another attack of your choosing with the increased momentum. It is also possible to cancel your jumpsquat frames into either Up Strong (or Up Tilt as Wrastor) and Up Special. As a demonstration, the below clip presents an Orcane cancelling Nair’s landing lag directly into an up special to prevent their opponent from being able to tech before the attack begins.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although this was only a 4 frame difference in the previous clip, this technique opens up a wide variety of combo options that would not be otherwise available, or at a minimum strengthens existing options by allowing you to begin them 4-6 frames earlier. There are not many Up Specials which have increased combo potential from this technique, but there are many notable examples of aerials that can link into Up Strong when cancelling the landing lag. The below clip shows a handful of aerials from across the cast (in alphabetical order) that can lead to a kill if you hitfall and cancel your landing lag directly into your Up Strong or Up Special.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Not all of these will connect reliably on all DI options, but some are extremely strong options (or even true combos in some cases) that make the threat of any of your aerials increase tenfold.&lt;/p>

Ranno&amp;rsquo;s Up Air 1 is a unique move in that it applies a set amount of knockback and hitstun. This allows the move to function the same whether the enemy is at 0% or 200%. Knowing this, let&amp;rsquo;s look at what scenarios will allow us to reliably combo this hitbox into other moves. The factors this will depend on include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The opponent&amp;rsquo;s weight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What move we choose to follow up with&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How close to the ground we land Up Air 1&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The more weight a character has, the less hitstun they take, which means the heavier character will be able to act out quicker. This is very apparent when going for Jab, Down Tilt, and Forward Tilt followups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Against a lighter character like Maypul, all 3 of these followups are true combos.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our move selection is affected by the fact that upon landing after connecting Up Air 1, we&amp;rsquo;ll be put into 4 frames of landing lag. We can choose to wait this lag out and use a grounded option like we did above, or we can &lt;a href="https://rivals.academy/lectures/understanding-landing-lag/#using-jumpsquat">cancel that lag into a jump&lt;/a>, which lets us either follow up with an aerial or cancel our jump into an Up Strong instead.
Ranno&amp;rsquo;s fastest grounded followups, shown in the earlier clips, take 9 frames (4f landing lag + 5f attack start up).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following up with Nair also takes 9 frames (5f jumpsquat + 4f attack startup), making it a viable combo option as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The closer we are to the ground when we connect with the Up Air, the less time it takes to fall to the ground and become actionable, giving us better ability to follow up. So far, all of our examples have used a buffered shorthop Up Air, but if we space the Up Air so we&amp;rsquo;re right next to the ground when it hits, we&amp;rsquo;ll be actionable up to 2 frames sooner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With those extra frames, we can now combo into Up Strong!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;re armed with an understanding of all the factors, we can reference this table that summarizes the viability of Ranno&amp;rsquo;s Up Air 1 combos based on them:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="table.png" alt="Table summarizing the viability of Ranno&amp;amp;rsquo;s Up Air 1 combos based on weight, followup choice, and spacing">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Even though some of these combos are labeled &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;, they can be really hard to pull off, as you have to be frame perfect in your jumps and attacks. However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t take away from the effectiveness of Up Air 1. The move comes out so fast (especially combined with hitfalls) it barely gives your opponent anytime to react and put out a defensive option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: None of these combos will true followup regardless of character weight, the followup move, or Up Air spacing if Up Air 1 is crouch cancelled. If you see an opponent crouch cancel your Up Air 1, I suggest you wait out their parry and punish accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of Up Air 1&amp;rsquo;s utility outside of being a move used to true combo into other moves:&lt;/p>
