&lt;p>When characters leave a platform, they will carry some amount of speed with them into the air depending on their status and properties. Characters who are faster on the ground than in the air have their speed capped upon leaving mostly due to their &amp;ldquo;Max Horizontal Jump Speed&amp;rdquo; stat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where &lt;strong>boosting&lt;/strong> comes in, a catch-all term for techniques involving leaving a platform during initial dash that enables certain characters to bypass those speed caps. This can be used to enable highly effective burst movement around platforms, shown below.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Boosting is split up into four techniques: platboost, ledgeboost, platmoost, and ledgemoost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two subcategories of these techniques are &lt;strong>platboosting&lt;/strong> vs. &lt;strong>ledgeboosting&lt;/strong>. These refer to whether you leave the platform by dropping through with a platform drop (&lt;strong>platboost&lt;/strong>) or by dashing off the edge (&lt;strong>ledgeboost&lt;/strong>) during your initial dash. Note that the duration of initial dashes varies across the cast from 8 to 16 frames, with the longer dashes giving you a larger window for performing the tech. These techniques will &lt;em>not&lt;/em> work if you enter the run animation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second distinction is &lt;strong>boosting&lt;/strong> vs. &lt;strong>moosting&lt;/strong>. &lt;strong>Boost&lt;/strong> refers to performing the tech via an initial dash. &lt;strong>Moost&lt;/strong> refers to performing the tech via a moonwalk, which has similar behavior to initial dash, but at max speed is 20% faster than initial dash for all characters (and youâ€™ll be traveling backwards).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With that explanation out of the way, here is my qualitative summary of the effectiveness of these techniques across the cast. Characters that stand to benefit from learning this tech (in my opinion) are bolded.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="cast-comparison.png" alt="Table summarizing the viability of Platboost, Ledgeboost, Platmoost, and Ledgemoost across the cast">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tech can be used to enhance a variety of options: going deep for edgeguards, faster movement for platdrop aerials, traveling across platforms, and more.

Performed correctly, it&amp;rsquo;s a true confirm on the entire cast well into Up Strong kill %.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shine &amp;gt; Up Strong is performed by using a Shine from an initial dash so that you slide forward while the Shine connects. From this, jump cancel out of the Shine, then use that to do a jump canceled Up Strong during your jump squat.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are two commons issues many have. The first is fireballing instead of getting the sliding shine. If this happens, you are holding the direction on your stick for too long which causes a side input to be read. Make sure that the stick returns to a neutral position to avoid those costly fireballs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second issue is an Up Special in place. This is caused by pressing jump too soon in the sequence which causes your Shine + Up Strong to be read as an Up Special since you are pressing special and up at the same time. Make sure that you are making your inputs in the order of Dash &amp;gt; Shine &amp;gt; Jump &amp;gt; Up Strong, and return to practicing each part individually if you find yourself struggling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Down Strong allows you to cover a range of distances by preserving some of your momentum as you start the move, as well as allowing you to drift slightly in either direction during your rise into the air. The below clip demonstrates how different methods of movement allow you to manipulate the horizontal distance of your leap. Mail of Momentum (MoM) changes the properties of your wavedash and run turnaround significantly, having it equipped will change how you can use the move to your advantage.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Shovel Knightâ€™s vertical leap can be increased by holding up during Down Strongâ€™s startup. If you are holding up on the 6th frame of startup youâ€™ll be boosted upwards slightly, allowing you to land on standard height platforms from the stage floor. Although a slightly slower kill option than Up Strong from directly beneath a platform, this option is relevant on almost every stage in the game and can cover a wider area more reliably if you are approaching from a short distance away. In combination with some of the longer distance leaps at your disposal you can use this as a powerful aerial approach, with the strong landing hitboxes becoming active from frame 18 onwards.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Charging Down Strong will increase Shovel Knightâ€™s height for 1 extra frame before his vertical position is locked in. Although not terribly notable, in combination with a boosted jump this allows you to reach the platforms on Abyssal Gates from the ground. The charge window begins on frame 17 of the attack, with only 1 frame of charge is required to increase the height. Shovel Knight will hover at this height during the full duration of the charge window (maximum of 60 frames). During the charge window you also gain the ability to also alter your horizontal position slightly during the charge by inputting left or right.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dynamo Mail allows Shovel Knight to perform any of his strong attacks in the air after a successful Down Air, providing him an aura which lasts for 600 frames, but is removed on hit. Combined with Down Strongâ€™s vertical leap, this provides Shovel Knight the ability to super-jump with the attack when buffered during the jump-squat frames. Youâ€™ll notice your peak height will increase on either a short hop or full hop, with the full hop variation launching you much higher into the air. This can allow Shovel Knight to threaten even the highest platforms from a grounded position, impacting your attack options in neutral, the amount of space you can cover against a recovering opponent or even as a tech chase option.&lt;/p>

All characters have both default landing lag values and specific landing lag values should you land during an aerial. The standard default landing lag value is 4 frames, with the six heavy characters (Kragg, Etalus, Sylvanos, Elliana, Hodan, and Olympia) having an increased default value of 6 frames. While the landing lag mechanic is designed to slow you down to some degree, youâ€™ll find that there are several ways that you can avoid the full extent of your landing lag. Here are some of things that you need to know if you want to speed up your play.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Similar to how the endlag of most of your normal attacks works, landing lag has interactions with the hit cancelling (or whiff lag) mechanic. On hitting your opponent your landing lag is reduced by one third, allowing you to more effectively combo your hits without any extra input required. If this reduced value on hit is lower than your default landing lag it will increase to the default value instead.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If your aerial successfully connects with another character or object before you interrupt it by landing you will be able to cancel the last 5 frames of your aerialâ€™s landing lag into jumpsquat, allowing you to become airborne on the same frame you would normally be actionable on the ground. Although this mechanic also works with your default landing lag, the ability to perform multiple aerials in quick succession or cancel your landing into a faster wavedash approach is invaluable in any characterâ€™s kit. Learning to hitfall your aerials and cancel your landing lag into jumpsquat is arguably one of the most important skills to learn if you want to improve.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Itâ€™s worth noting that heavy characters (Kragg, Etalus, Sylvanos, Elliana, Hodan, Olympia) arguably benefit more from being able to cancel their landing lag into jumpsquat. Since heavy characters&amp;rsquo; default landing lag value is 6, they will be unable to cancel the entirety of the landing lag into jumpsquat, only the last 5 frames. Despite this, if an aerialâ€™s on hit landing lag value for a heavy character is 6 frames or less it will be possible to cancel the full amount into jumpsquat, effectively allowing you to act 1 frame sooner than what should be possible. The below example of Kraggâ€™s neutral air, a move with 6 frames of landing on hit, when cancelled into jumpsquat on the first frame of landing lag is fully actionable in the air on frame 6.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As you can cancel your landing lag into jumpsquat, you are also effectively able to cancel it into other actions as well. There are obvious movement benefits of being able to wavedash out of your landing lag, which can then subsequently be cancelled into another attack of your choosing with the increased momentum. It is also possible to cancel your jumpsquat frames into either Up Strong (or Up Tilt as Wrastor) and Up Special. As a demonstration, the below clip presents an Orcane cancelling Nairâ€™s landing lag directly into an up special to prevent their opponent from being able to tech before the attack begins.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although this was only a 4 frame difference in the previous clip, this technique opens up a wide variety of combo options that would not be otherwise available, or at a minimum strengthens existing options by allowing you to begin them 4-6 frames earlier. There are not many Up Specials which have increased combo potential from this technique, but there are many notable examples of aerials that can link into Up Strong when cancelling the landing lag. The below clip shows a handful of aerials from across the cast (in alphabetical order) that can lead to a kill if you hitfall and cancel your landing lag directly into your Up Strong or Up Special.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Not all of these will connect reliably on all DI options, but some are extremely strong options (or even true combos in some cases) that make the threat of any of your aerials increase tenfold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Head into practice mode and start refining your options out of landing lag and you&amp;rsquo;re guaranteed to see some results.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Ranno Up Air 1</title><link>https://rivals.academy/lectures/understanding-ranno-upair1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivals.academy/lectures/understanding-ranno-upair1/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are a lot of misconceptions about whether this move is true in certain combos or not, and I&amp;rsquo;m here to clear them all up right here in this post! Ranno&amp;rsquo;s Up Air 1 is a unique move in that it applies a set amount of knockback and hitstun. This allows the move to function the same whether the enemy is at 0% or 200%. Knowing this, let&amp;rsquo;s look at what scenarios will allow us to reliably combo this hitbox into other moves. The factors this will depend on include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The opponent&amp;rsquo;s weight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What move we choose to follow up with&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How close to the ground we land Up Air 1&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The more weight a character has, the less hitstun they take, which means the heavier character will be able to act out quicker. This is very apparent when going for Jab, Down Tilt, and Forward Tilt followups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Against a lighter character like Maypul, all 3 of these followups are true combos.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our move selection is affected by the fact that upon landing after connecting Up Air 1, we&amp;rsquo;ll be put into 4 frames of landing lag. We can choose to wait this lag out and use a grounded option like we did above, or we can &lt;a href="https://rivals.academy/lectures/understanding-landing-lag/#using-jumpsquat">cancel that lag into a jump&lt;/a>, which lets us either follow up with an aerial or cancel our jump into an Up Strong instead.
Ranno&amp;rsquo;s fastest grounded followups, shown in the earlier clips, take 9 frames (4f landing lag + 5f attack start up).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following up with Nair also takes 9 frames (5f jumpsquat + 4f attack startup), making it a viable combo option as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But even with an immediate jump cancel, Up Strong will take 11 frames to come out (11f attack startup), slow enough to be parryable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The closer we are to the ground when we connect with the Up Air, the less time it takes to fall to the ground and become actionable, giving us better ability to follow up. So far, all of our examples have used a buffered shorthop Up Air, but if we space the Up Air so we&amp;rsquo;re right next to the ground when it hits, we&amp;rsquo;ll be actionable up to 2 frames sooner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With those extra frames, we can now combo into Up Strong!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;re armed with an understanding of all the factors, we can reference this table that summarizes the viability of Ranno&amp;rsquo;s Up Air 1 combos based on them:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="table.png" alt="Table summarizing the viability of Ranno&amp;amp;rsquo;s Up Air 1 combos based on weight, followup choice, and spacing">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Even though some of these combos are labeled &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;, they can be really hard to pull off, as you have to be frame perfect in your jumps and attacks. However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t take away from the effectiveness of Up Air 1. The move comes out so fast (especially combined with hitfalls) it barely gives your opponent anytime to react and put out a defensive option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: None of these combos will true followup regardless of character weight, the followup move, or Up Air spacing if Up Air 1 is crouch cancelled. If you see an opponent crouch cancel your Up Air 1, I suggest you wait out their parry and punish accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of Up Air 1&amp;rsquo;s utility outside of being a move used to true combo into other moves:&lt;/p>
