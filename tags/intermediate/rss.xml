&lt;p>When characters leave a platform, they will carry some amount of speed with them into the air depending on their status and properties. Characters who are faster on the ground than in the air have their speed capped upon leaving mostly due to their &amp;ldquo;Max Horizontal Jump Speed&amp;rdquo; stat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where &lt;strong>boosting&lt;/strong> comes in, a catch-all term for techniques involving leaving a platform during initial dash that enables certain characters to bypass those speed caps. This can be used to enable highly effective burst movement around platforms, shown below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Boosting is split up into four techniques: platboost, ledgeboost, platmoost, and ledgemoost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first two subcategories of these techniques are &lt;strong>platboosting&lt;/strong> vs. &lt;strong>ledgeboosting&lt;/strong>. These refer to whether you leave the platform by dropping through with a platform drop (&lt;strong>platboost&lt;/strong>) or by dashing off the edge (&lt;strong>ledgeboost&lt;/strong>) during your initial dash. Note that the duration of initial dashes varies across the cast from 8 to 16 frames, with the longer dashes giving you a larger window for performing the tech. These techniques will &lt;em>not&lt;/em> work if you enter the run animation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second distinction is &lt;strong>boosting&lt;/strong> vs. &lt;strong>moosting&lt;/strong>. &lt;strong>Boost&lt;/strong> refers to performing the tech via an initial dash. &lt;strong>Moost&lt;/strong> refers to performing the tech via a moonwalk, which has similar behavior to initial dash, but at max speed is 20% faster than initial dash for all characters (and you’ll be traveling backwards).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With that explanation out of the way, here is my qualitative summary of the effectiveness of these techniques across the cast. Characters that stand to benefit from learning this tech (in my opinion) are bolded.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This tech can be used to enhance a variety of options: going deep for edgeguards, faster movement for platdrop aerials, traveling across platforms, and more.

&lt;p>For the more experienced Maypul players (or just the ones who have finished Maypul’s tutorial), you’re likely aware that her Side Special can be reversed.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Reverse Side Special is performed by inputting the opposite direction of your initial Side Special within four frames of inputting it.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Now, four frames seems like a very short amount of time, but practice this enough and you’ll get the hang of it in no time. However, this post isn’t just about the existence of Reverse Side Special. Instead, I’ll be going through some practical applications of Reverse Side Special and why it’s yet another invaluable tool in Maypul’s arsenal.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before continuing, I’d like to discuss the main problem with Side Special as a combo tool: the fact that it doesn’t easily lead into followups. As an example:&lt;/p>

or
&lt;a href="https://rivals.academy/lectures/reverse-maypul-side-special/no-followup.mp4">MP4&lt;/a>
video.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Because of how separated Maypul and Zetterburn are, it turns any potential followups into a tech chase. Indeed, Side Special is even laggier of whiff than if reversed by 9 frames.&lt;/p>

video.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>So, how does reversing this hitbox help us follow up? Take a look at the Reverse Side Special demonstration again. Notice how the hitbox angle comes back with us? This is where things get spicy. Because the opponent is sent towards where Maypul ends up, Reverse Side Special into Dtilt is a very common combo.&lt;/p>

video.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>This works on no DI and DI in consistently, however if the opponent chooses to DI out, it will connect at around 40%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How about wrapping with Lily?&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let’s discuss a hypothetical situation:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="zetterburn-lily.png" alt="Zetterburn between Maypul and her Lily">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m in front of this Zetterburn, and I’d like him to get wrapped. Sure, I could throw seed and Ftilt him into Lily, but I’d like something I can do now. I can’t just Side Special, as that will send him opposite of Lily, and the same case with Reverse Side Special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Introducing &lt;strong>Turnaround Reverse Side Special&lt;/strong>. If you input a Side Special &lt;em>opposite&lt;/em> to the direction you’re facing (even when running), you’ll immediately turn around and begin the Side Special animation.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Notice how we can approach using Turnaround Side Special and get an opening with all the benefits of Reverse Side Special without needing to be in close quarters with the opponent. In addition, notice how Reverse and Turnaround Reverse Side Special send in different directions. Reverse Side Special sends towards the initial hit, while Turnaround Reverse Side Special sends away from the initial hit. This can be used to punish predictable DI and get yourself into a position to extend combos even further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As always, using this tech too much will get you punished (parries or otherwise), so be careful and don’t spam these in the midst of battle. However, with an appropriate use during a match, Reverse Side Special can lead to bonus opportunities and punishes that wouldn’t have been available otherwise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shine > Up Strong</title><link>https://rivals.academy/lectures/shine-upstrong/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivals.academy/lectures/shine-upstrong/</guid><description>&lt;p>Zetterburn&amp;rsquo;s Shine &amp;gt; Up Strong is one of the strongest kill options in the game as it is almost always applicable for a parry punish and is a follow up off of a frame 2 move (Shine) that can also be used to whiff punish effectively.

&lt;p>Shine &amp;gt; Up Strong is performed by using a Shine from an initial dash so that you slide forward while the Shine connects. From this, jump cancel out of the Shine, then use that to do a jump canceled Up Strong during your jump squat.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are two commons issues many have. The first is fireballing instead of getting the sliding shine. If this happens, you are holding the direction on your stick for too long which causes a side input to be read. Make sure that the stick returns to a neutral position to avoid those costly fireballs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second issue is an Up Special in place. This is caused by pressing jump too soon in the sequence which causes your Shine + Up Strong to be read as an Up Special since you are pressing special and up at the same time. Make sure that you are making your inputs in the order of Dash &amp;gt; Shine &amp;gt; Jump &amp;gt; Up Strong, and return to practicing each part individually if you find yourself struggling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Down Strong allows you to cover a range of distances by preserving some of your momentum as you start the move, as well as allowing you to drift slightly in either direction during your rise into the air. The below clip demonstrates how different methods of movement allow you to manipulate the horizontal distance of your leap. Mail of Momentum (MoM) changes the properties of your wavedash and run turnaround significantly, having it equipped will change how you can use the move to your advantage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shovel Knight’s vertical leap can be increased by holding up during Down Strong’s startup. If you are holding up on the 6th frame of startup you’ll be boosted upwards slightly, allowing you to land on standard height platforms from the stage floor. Although a slightly slower kill option than Up Strong from directly beneath a platform, this option is relevant on almost every stage in the game and can cover a wider area more reliably if you are approaching from a short distance away. In combination with some of the longer distance leaps at your disposal you can use this as a powerful aerial approach, with the strong landing hitboxes becoming active from frame 18 onwards.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charging Down Strong will increase Shovel Knight’s height for 1 extra frame before his vertical position is locked in. Although not terribly notable, in combination with a boosted jump this allows you to reach the platforms on Abyssal Gates from the ground. The charge window begins on frame 17 of the attack, with only 1 frame of charge is required to increase the height. Shovel Knight will hover at this height during the full duration of the charge window (maximum of 60 frames). During the charge window you also gain the ability to also alter your horizontal position slightly during the charge by inputting left or right.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dynamo Mail allows Shovel Knight to perform any of his strong attacks in the air after a successful Down Air, providing him an aura which lasts for 600 frames, but is removed on hit. Combined with Down Strong’s vertical leap, this provides Shovel Knight the ability to super-jump with the attack when buffered during the jump-squat frames. You’ll notice your peak height will increase on either a short hop or full hop, with the full hop variation launching you much higher into the air. This can allow Shovel Knight to threaten even the highest platforms from a grounded position, impacting your attack options in neutral, the amount of space you can cover against a recovering opponent or even as a tech chase option.&lt;/p>

All characters have both default landing lag values and specific landing lag values should you land during an aerial. The standard default landing lag value is 4 frames, with the six heavy characters (Kragg, Etalus, Sylvanos, Elliana, Hodan, and Olympia) having an increased default value of 6 frames. While the landing lag mechanic is designed to slow you down to some degree, you’ll find that there are several ways that you can avoid the full extent of your landing lag. Here are some of things that you need to know if you want to speed up your play.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Similar to how the endlag of most of your normal attacks works, landing lag has interactions with the hit cancelling (or whiff lag) mechanic. On hitting your opponent your landing lag is reduced by one third, allowing you to more effectively combo your hits without any extra input required. If this reduced value on hit is lower than your default landing lag it will increase to the default value instead.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If your aerial successfully connects with another character or object before you interrupt it by landing you will be able to cancel the last 5 frames of your aerial’s landing lag into jumpsquat, allowing you to become airborne on the same frame you would normally be actionable on the ground. Although this mechanic also works with your default landing lag, the ability to perform multiple aerials in quick succession or cancel your landing into a faster wavedash approach is invaluable in any character’s kit. Learning to hitfall your aerials and cancel your landing lag into jumpsquat is arguably one of the most important skills to learn if you want to improve.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>It’s worth noting that heavy characters (Kragg, Etalus, Sylvanos, Elliana, Hodan, Olympia) arguably benefit more from being able to cancel their landing lag into jumpsquat. Since heavy characters&amp;rsquo; default landing lag value is 6, they will be unable to cancel the entirety of the landing lag into jumpsquat, only the last 5 frames. Despite this, if an aerial’s on hit landing lag value for a heavy character is 6 frames or less it will be possible to cancel the full amount into jumpsquat, effectively allowing you to act 1 frame sooner than what should be possible. The below example of Kragg’s neutral air, a move with 6 frames of landing on hit, when cancelled into jumpsquat on the first frame of landing lag is fully actionable in the air on frame 6.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As you can cancel your landing lag into jumpsquat, you are also effectively able to cancel it into other actions as well. There are obvious movement benefits of being able to wavedash out of your landing lag, which can then subsequently be cancelled into another attack of your choosing with the increased momentum. It is also possible to cancel your jumpsquat frames into either Up Strong (or Up Tilt as Wrastor) and Up Special. As a demonstration, the below clip presents an Orcane cancelling Nair’s landing lag directly into an up special to prevent their opponent from being able to tech before the attack begins.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although this was only a 4 frame difference in the previous clip, this technique opens up a wide variety of combo options that would not be otherwise available, or at a minimum strengthens existing options by allowing you to begin them 4-6 frames earlier. There are not many Up Specials which have increased combo potential from this technique, but there are many notable examples of aerials that can link into Up Strong when cancelling the landing lag. The below clip shows a handful of aerials from across the cast (in alphabetical order) that can lead to a kill if you hitfall and cancel your landing lag directly into your Up Strong or Up Special.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Not all of these will connect reliably on all DI options, but some are extremely strong options (or even true combos in some cases) that make the threat of any of your aerials increase tenfold.&lt;/p>

Ranno&amp;rsquo;s Up Air 1 is a unique move in that it applies a set amount of knockback and hitstun. This allows the move to function the same whether the enemy is at 0% or 200%. Knowing this, let&amp;rsquo;s look at what scenarios will allow us to reliably combo this hitbox into other moves. The factors this will depend on include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The opponent&amp;rsquo;s weight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What move we choose to follow up with&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How close to the ground we land Up Air 1&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The more weight a character has, the less hitstun they take, which means the heavier character will be able to act out quicker. This is very apparent when going for Jab, Down Tilt, and Forward Tilt followups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Against a lighter character like Maypul, all 3 of these followups are true combos.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our move selection is affected by the fact that upon landing after connecting Up Air 1, we&amp;rsquo;ll be put into 4 frames of landing lag. We can choose to wait this lag out and use a grounded option like we did above, or we can &lt;a href="https://rivals.academy/lectures/understanding-landing-lag/#using-jumpsquat">cancel that lag into a jump&lt;/a>, which lets us either follow up with an aerial or cancel our jump into an Up Strong instead.
Ranno&amp;rsquo;s fastest grounded followups, shown in the earlier clips, take 9 frames (4f landing lag + 5f attack start up).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following up with Nair also takes 9 frames (5f jumpsquat + 4f attack startup), making it a viable combo option as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But even with an immediate jump cancel, Up Strong will take 11 frames to come out (11f attack startup), slow enough to be parryable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The closer we are to the ground when we connect with the Up Air, the less time it takes to fall to the ground and become actionable, giving us better ability to follow up. So far, all of our examples have used a buffered shorthop Up Air, but if we space the Up Air so we&amp;rsquo;re right next to the ground when it hits, we&amp;rsquo;ll be actionable up to 2 frames sooner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With those extra frames, we can now combo into Up Strong!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;re armed with an understanding of all the factors, we can reference this table that summarizes the viability of Ranno&amp;rsquo;s Up Air 1 combos based on them:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="table.png" alt="Table summarizing the viability of Ranno&amp;amp;rsquo;s Up Air 1 combos based on weight, followup choice, and spacing">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Even though some of these combos are labeled &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo;, they can be really hard to pull off, as you have to be frame perfect in your jumps and attacks. However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t take away from the effectiveness of Up Air 1. The move comes out so fast (especially combined with hitfalls) it barely gives your opponent anytime to react and put out a defensive option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: None of these combos will true followup regardless of character weight, the followup move, or Up Air spacing if Up Air 1 is crouch cancelled. If you see an opponent crouch cancel your Up Air 1, I suggest you wait out their parry and punish accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of Up Air 1&amp;rsquo;s utility outside of being a move used to true combo into other moves:&lt;/p>

Because of how freeform Wrastor can be played, this guide is more focused on explaining the strategy and concepts. As such, other Wrastor players may have their own approaches to the character but I believe the information here is general enough to be applicable by anyone. This guide is not intended to be all-encompassing; there are many more aspects of Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s game to explore beyond what I write about here.&lt;/p>

&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most common strategy employed in neutral by Wrastor players is known as &amp;ldquo;bait and punish&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;whiff punish.&amp;rdquo; Rather than rushdown, chip away at opponents, or dominate stage control, Wrastor instead seeks to access his explosive punish game while avoiding any unnecessary damage in the most effective way possible. The strategy works as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s high horizontal speed in Slipstream and/or multiple jumps to enter your opponent&amp;rsquo;s attack range, baiting them into attacking you&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Preemptively move away to avoid the attack&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Punish the endlag of their whiffed attack and begin your combo&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This strategy is universal to fighting games, but Wrastors utilize it heavily for a few main reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wrastor has fast movement and quick high ranged melee attacks, both making the technique easier&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wrastor is so light that trading is almost never in his favor— he wants clean openings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wrastor relies on extended combos to kill— he does not have effective tools to apply stage control or chip damage from afar&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="grounded-play" class="heading">
Grounded Play&lt;button class="heading-link"

aria-label="Copy link to this section: Grounded Play"
onclick="copyHeadingLink(&amp;#34;grounded-play&amp;#34;)">
&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512">&lt;path d="M224 0c-35.3 0-64 28.7-64 64V288c0 35.3 28.7 64 64 64H448c35.3 0 64-28.7 64-64V64c0-35.3-28.7-64-64-64H224zM64 160c-35.3 0-64 28.7-64 64V448c0 35.3 28.7 64 64 64H288c35.3 0 64-28.7 64-64V384H288v64H64V224h64V160H64z"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Slipstream, Wrastor gains access to some of the fastest and most versatile grounded movement in the game. Utilize your increased speed with dash dancing, wavedashing, and even moonwalking to maintain tricky movement and capitalize when your opponent slips up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to space tilts on the ground, characters must normally either wavedash, babydash, walk, or run-cancel (crouch), all of which have their benefits and drawbacks. Wavedashing and run-cancelling require commitments of 6 and 16 frames respectively, while walking is very slow, and babydashing is challenging to be consistent with. However, due to an interesting quirk regarding his strongs only being usable in the air, Wrastor has the powerful ability to cancel his initial dash with a tilt at any time simply by inputting the tilt with strong rather than attack, allowing for quick, precise, and easy to execute adjustments to your grounded spacing.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>A common whiff punish situation is baiting aerials from below. Since Wrastor lacks a good anti-air, if you anticipate one coming you can move out of the way and punish the landing lag instead of parrying/rolling, which are more committal and can be intentionally baited. Note that different characters will have different landing lag values.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s very high horizontal aerial mobility in Slipstream, combined with having access to 3 midair jumps, grants him unparallelled ability to feign attacks from above and bait his opponent into committing to a punishable anti-air or defensive option. Drifting in and back out of their range is very effective, especially in Slipstream.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Combine with using waveland platform movement to reset your jumps, Dash Attack off platforms, and platdrop aerials to really make your movement unpredictable and explosive.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Another consideration is move choice. Generally you&amp;rsquo;re looking to get in with moves that are a good combination of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Disjointed (hitbox extends past hurtbox), typically also implies high range&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fast startup and/or low endlag/FAF&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Long hitbox duration relative to the total move&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If I had to rank Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s moves in terms of their utility in neutral:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>S&lt;/strong>: Bair, Dtilt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A&lt;/strong>: Dash Attack, Jab, Nair, Slipstream (projectile), Fair&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>B&lt;/strong>: Up Air, Dair, Ftilt, Down Special&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>F&lt;/strong>: Everything else&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now all this isn&amp;rsquo;t to say this is the only effective neutral strategy. Mixing in raw approaches or some occasional chip-damage play keeps the opponent on their toes, especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve proven to them you can bait and punish so effectively that it makes them attack shy, giving you easy openings. Make sure to experiment and look to combine this neutral strategy with the upcoming punish game strategies and you&amp;rsquo;ll be well on your way to winning more games with the bird.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Consider the phrase “&lt;strong>With Wrastor, everything is possible, but nothing is guaranteed.&lt;/strong>” Rather than rely on a few consistent kill confirms, Wrastor instead has access to over 200 potential ways to set up for a kill, as every single one of his normals can combo into any of his kill moves given the right conditions. As such, a common strategy birds employ is one of positional advantage. After tacking on some damage, look to combo your opponent towards a blastzone where you can either bait or outright force certain DI that you&amp;rsquo;re ready for, enabling you to land the killing blow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Use Bair, Up Air, Fair, and Dair to juggle them, doing your best to anticipate their DI and keep them close.

&lt;p>All of your aerials and tilts can link into Forward Strong on the right DI. Sweetspot Up Special can replace it as it has similar strength (but different spacing), but it carries more risk and can be finicky to connect if the setup isn&amp;rsquo;t quite right. ~43% of Wrastor kills from &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18c7od0wON5htoKAXrdSFzmAy3B92KkhRy21s6n-aQeI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my study&lt;/a> were from Fstrong, so it should be your primary kill option.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Look for Up Strong, rising Neutral Special, and Up Special. If you think they&amp;rsquo;ll DI your next hit out, either use Dair to mix up or let Forward Strong/Nair rip to throw them offstage (or outright kill off the side). Being able to recognize when to switch your target blastzone is an important sense to develop.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wrastor has endless combinations for combos, and can be played extremely freeform. Every Wrastor ends up developing their own combo style. But despite our best intentions, mistakes will happen and we’ll often be left with an opponent at mid-high%s in neutral. &lt;strong>Once most characters get past 80-100% or so, many of Wrastor’s aerial confirms stop working as well&lt;/strong> and need the right setup and/or DI. In this situation, throwing out raw Claps is an easy way to get yourself punished; Instead you’ll want to use moves that are safer to throw out and can combo better at a variety of %s, aiming to react to their DI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best mid-high% confirms for this include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dtilt &amp;gt; Clap&lt;/strong>. Up Strong will usually kill earlier, but Fstrong works better to catch DI out, which will be easier if Slipstream is already out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dash Attack (off plat) &amp;gt; Clap&lt;/strong>. This combo works at nearly any % and is usually very reactable due to the low endlag and preservation of momentum the move offers. Grounded dash attack can also work, but is laggier.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Down Special &amp;gt; Clap&lt;/strong>. This works best if you already have Slipstream out. If you can’t reach them, this move will force a techchase in almost any circumstance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Here I set a bot to 130% with random DI and react to land the Clap. You can also use Sweetspot Up Special in place of Clap, but it can be tougher to land.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are plenty more options to consider here, but they are not as universal or as easy to set up as the above, often requiring a parry to set up or convenient DI to land. These include Up Tilt Spike &amp;gt; Clap and Jab 3 &amp;gt; Clap. Speaking of parry punishes, most Wrastors will just use raw Up Special (or run through Up Special), which can be countered by DI up. But by using one of the options discussed here instead, you can call out that DI up/in with a combo move, setting up for an easy Clap or Up Special that will kill earlier than the raw Up Special would have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If they really start getting to high %s (&amp;gt;130%) you can attempt to land &lt;strong>stray hits&lt;/strong> such as early bair, which due to its high knockback growth can outright kill with DI in from plats or often set up for a Sour Up Special near the top.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Similarly, an Early Nair 2 can throw them off the side without the endlag of a Clap if you whiff. Dair spike will also start outright killing here, you just need them to be above ledge or offstage (or miss the tech).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you continue to play, experiment with different combo options and kill setups to find your own way of accomplishing things. As you gain experience with Wrastor and get familiar with his kit you can keep adding options to your arsenal to help answer any defensive strategy the opponent may throw your way.&lt;/p>

&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the first major guidelines players often abide by is “DI out to escape combos, DI in to survive kill moves”. So as Wrastor, let&amp;rsquo;s explore ways we can counter that strategy and maintain that positional advantage we discussed above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing to know is that being in Slipstream generally gives Wrastor the ability to cover DI out if you can maintain your momentum. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the basic scenario where they&amp;rsquo;re in front of you at low-mid% and you&amp;rsquo;re moving to the right. Here your main three combo tools will be Up Air, Fair, and Nair, which cover a good range of angles. The goal is to keep them within your melee attack range, but continue to push them sideways so you can maintain your momentum.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you think they&amp;rsquo;ll hold out (→), use Up Air (75°) or Inner Fair (60°) to keep them close.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you think they&amp;rsquo;ll hold in (←), use Nair (30° + 45°) or Tipper Fair (40°) to push them outwards.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Blend these together and switch between them based on your opponent&amp;rsquo;s actions. Land a few of these, and they&amp;rsquo;ll be offstage where you can set up to finish the stock. Pictured below are the zones where these moves can send vs. Zetter at 50%, with the main dotted path showing no DI or drift.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="example.png" alt="Graphic displaying the ranges a Zetterburn at 50% can be sent by Wrastor Up Air 1, Inner Fair, and Nair">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re the one getting comboed by Wrastor in Slipstream, you want to leave that zone. Your options include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Holding in the first few hits to shift yourself up and disrupt his momentum, giving you better odds at escape&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re near stage, hold hard down/out to get low and try to land a tech&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DI to the nearest platform and look to tech or use a grounded wakeup option&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now, what if we&amp;rsquo;re in the same position, but without access to Slipstream? Even an Up Air may not keep them close enough vs. DI out, especially if our rightward momentum has been disrupted. You could try an early Fstrong or Up Special and send them flying sideways, but if they hold in, it probably won&amp;rsquo;t kill. Here we can consider using the greatest mix up tool in the game: &lt;strong>Dair&lt;/strong>. Unlike most moves that push up and/or away, Dair will instead throw them &lt;em>across&lt;/em> Wrastor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="dair.png" alt="Graphic demonstrating that Dair sends across Wrastor">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dair is absurdly powerful for combos. Normally, DI out/down lets people escape once they&amp;rsquo;re in front of you, so the main mix up most characterss have is simply whether they use a combo move (like Fair) or kill move (like Fstrong/Up Special), but Dair gives us a 3rd option: throw them backwards, keeping them close for follow up and allowing you to continue the combo upwards instead. This lets you choose between setting up an edgeguard vs. juggling them for more damage. The best counterplay to avoid this mixup is to DI straight down, but this can be risky as it does almost nothing vs. Up Air and is also very poor DI on Fstrong/Up Special.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="example-dair.png" alt="Previous Zetterburn example graphic, with Dair added">&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Dair also provides another useful function, arguably more important than the first. Say they unexpectedly held in and you&amp;rsquo;ve overshot your position— they&amp;rsquo;re behind you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="example-overshoot.png" alt="Graphic displaying the ranges a Zetterburn at 50% behind Wrastor can be sent by Early Bair, Up Air 3, and Dair">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we have a similar scenario to last time, except it&amp;rsquo;s even worse due to our momentum being in the wrong direction (headed right, but need to chase left). Even with Slipstream speed and a vertical move like Up Air 3, if they hold out (←) we may not be able to shift momentum in time. Dair rescues us again here. The back hit brings them in front of or above us, letting us combo and adjust for overshoot.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s consider a scenario where their DI got the better of you: they screwed up your momentum and are just outside of melee range. Here, we can consider &lt;strong>throwing the Slipstream projectile itself to attempt to keep the combo going&lt;/strong>. It barely has any hitstun, but can interrupt your opponent&amp;rsquo;s momentum and/or attack startup and give you a brief window to combo. Plus, now you have Slipstream active, which lets you follow up on DI out if they try it again.&lt;/p>

video.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>This technique comes with a huge caveat, however: &lt;strong>followups off of Slipstream are almost never true&lt;/strong>. Even with optimal spacing, if Slipstream hits the front of their hurtbox it can always be airdodged out of or often countered by fast attacks. While it is difficult to react to, experienced opponents may be aware of this scenario and be ready to break out. Balancing the risk/reward of combo extensions is an essential Wrastor skill that comes with time, so experiment and model your playstyle accordingly.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While Slipstream and Dair are both incredibly powerful tools, remember that Wrastor can still utilize traditional mixups, namely choosing when to use a strong attack vs. a weak combo tool. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve been landing Dash Attack -&amp;gt; Fstrong, so they hold in to survive. Instead, you can go for an Up Air/Fair off the Dash Attack, which on DI in should set up nicely for an Up Strong off the top. Getting a feel for making these decisions is another important skill for Wrastor players to develop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This analysis has dealt mainly with aerial-based combos, but do not neglect his grounded options! Using platform movement to combine aerial + grounded attacks is very powerful, but has more factors going on that are tougher to boil down. The same theory applies however: use moves that compliment your momentum and the situation at hand. Mixing in Dash Attacks is highly effective since it also serves as movement. Dtilt can be used as a standard combo tool that keeps them closer. Ftilt and Jab can serve as good pace-breakers and help to stop their momentum. Up Tilt can be used to push them offstage. DownB is tricky to land during combos but can be a useful reset tool. In short, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to use Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s wavelanding ability and grounded options to extend his combos in more unique ways instead of relying solely on aerial juggles.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>With all that said, I hope this guide served as a healthy introduction to Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s gameplan. He packs the most freeform combos in an already freeform game, so be sure to practice and experiment. Now go land some combos.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
