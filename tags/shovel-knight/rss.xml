&lt;p>Down Strong allows you to cover a range of distances by preserving some of your momentum as you start the move, as well as allowing you to drift slightly in either direction during your rise into the air. The below clip demonstrates how different methods of movement allow you to manipulate the horizontal distance of your leap. Mail of Momentum (MoM) changes the properties of your wavedash and run turnaround significantly, having it equipped will change how you can use the move to your advantage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shovel Knight’s vertical leap can be increased by holding up during Down Strong’s startup. If you are holding up on the 6th frame of startup you’ll be boosted upwards slightly, allowing you to land on standard height platforms from the stage floor. Although a slightly slower kill option than Up Strong from directly beneath a platform, this option is relevant on almost every stage in the game and can cover a wider area more reliably if you are approaching from a short distance away. In combination with some of the longer distance leaps at your disposal you can use this as a powerful aerial approach, with the strong landing hitboxes becoming active from frame 18 onwards.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Charging Down Strong will increase Shovel Knight’s height for 1 extra frame before his vertical position is locked in. Although not terribly notable, in combination with a boosted jump this allows you to reach the platforms on Abyssal Gates from the ground. The charge window begins on frame 17 of the attack, with only 1 frame of charge is required to increase the height. Shovel Knight will hover at this height during the full duration of the charge window (maximum of 60 frames). During the charge window you also gain the ability to also alter your horizontal position slightly during the charge by inputting left or right.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dynamo Mail allows Shovel Knight to perform any of his strong attacks in the air after a successful Down Air, providing him an aura which lasts for 600 frames, but is removed on hit. Combined with Down Strong’s vertical leap, this provides Shovel Knight the ability to super-jump with the attack when buffered during the jump-squat frames. You’ll notice your peak height will increase on either a short hop or full hop, with the full hop variation launching you much higher into the air. This can allow Shovel Knight to threaten even the highest platforms from a grounded position, impacting your attack options in neutral, the amount of space you can cover against a recovering opponent or even as a tech chase option.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You are also able to use the upwards boost you can gain during startup in combination with a super-jump Down Strong, meaning that while Dynamo Mail is equipped you have access to 6 different variations of Down Strong, each with a unique jump height. The below clip shows off the peak heights of each, with a detailed spreadsheet which records what variations can be used from the ground to quickly reach any platform in the game can be found &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qXCdb3DmMhVWXIrnwwBtX0DfPguaT7rN3sXTJ5StybI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
