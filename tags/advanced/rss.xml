&lt;p>While onstage, you have access to strong attacks, and coupled with Dair&amp;rsquo;s hefty hitstun, you have access to stable setups into your strongs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>While many of Ori&amp;rsquo;s kill setups require DI reads or guessing, Dair &amp;gt; Fstrong can be done on reaction. With Dair&amp;rsquo;s heavy hitstun, you have the freedom of being able to follow DI without any problems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Even on extreme levels of DI, SDI and drift, you can still catch them with an Fstrong, although at this level of DI the timing is very tight, and closer to a read than an actual setup.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Speaking of reads, Dair &amp;gt; Up Strong is exactly that, a read that can net you kill earlier than an Fstrong, at the cost of certainty.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>However, due to the laggy nature of Up Strong, you will have to pick a single option to cover, which overall makes this option potent, but somewhat unreliable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Considerations for the following setups:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>As with all moves fastfell offstage, you will be falling incredibly quick, don’t try to hit these setups if you are too close to the bottom blastzone, which will result in an SD.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I will be detailing these setups on DI in. If your opponent is DIing Dair out, you must follow them accordingly, or you will SD.&lt;/li>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While seemingly being a little extra, Dair &amp;gt; Bair sometimes gives that little boost of % needed to get a kill off the side blastzone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The scariest, riskiest, most satisfying thing to hit: Dair &amp;gt; Bash. This setup is the pinnacle of early kills, closing stocks at ridiculously low %s.&lt;/p>

video.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>An aspect unique to this setup is your position when going for the initial Dair. For lower %s, you should always aim to be above your opponent when landing the Dair, as being too low or inside of them will cause you to plummet below them, into an SD. At higher %s, you have flexibility as to where your initial Dair lands, but if possible, it’s the best option to always try to hit the Dair above. This setup will start to connect around 60% on the entire cast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nature of Ori revolves around having less set in stone kill confirms, so while fishing for them is a good way to lose stocks, having access to this list of consistent kill confirms out of Dair is still key to keep in mind.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On stages where the bottom blastzone is &lt;strong>412 pixels&lt;/strong> deep or larger, you can &lt;strong>runoff Dair&lt;/strong> and still have the means to make it back to stage.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fire Capital&lt;/li>

Combined with her above average air acceleration, this means she’s one of the best characters at edgecancelling her recovery. This is valuable as being able to edgecancel out of your pratfall can provide you with some unique recovery mixups, such as wavelanding back onto the stage or drifting back and approaching the ledge a second time with your resources refreshed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this guide we will cover how to edgecancel your recovery from various heights as you approach the stage. For all variations of shown you will need to drift forward until the end of the second hit. Inputs are shown in each clip if you’re struggling, so use these as a quick reference as you attempt these recoveries for yourself. Hitting the opponent with your Up Special will slightly alter the timing, however each example will still be possible to perform.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The safest way to edgecancel Up Special is to avoid riding the wall and using both hits above stage height so that you end up decently far in from the edge. You can then use the horizontal boost backwards with much less risk of an SD. You build up enough momentum as you drift back that you&amp;rsquo;ll slide slightly as you land, so don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t position yourself perfectly for these.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Edgecancelling after a wallride is slightly riskier, but it&amp;rsquo;s a very common position to be in when recovering so this variant might be the most useful one to master. It is usually performed by using both hits above stage height after riding up the wall, and leaving the stick in a neutral position during the horizontal boost window before immediately drifting back.&lt;/p>

&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you begin your Up Special from higher up, the method is very similar to doing a wallride. Avoid the horizontal boost and drift backwards, however. You will often need to start drifting back later than with the wallride variant.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Note: performing the second hit of your Up Special at this height may leave you vulnerable as you drift back towards the ledge, so keep in mind your opponent’s position when using this variation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This final variant is the hardest to pull off by far, but arguably the safest due to the minimal airtime above the ledge making it difficult to counter. Use only the final hit above stage height, then use the horizontal boost inwards before drifting back.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve started mastering this technique, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to follow these guidelines anymore. The ultimate goal is to be able to pull it off freely, from any position, at any time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gravity Jump</title><link>https://rivals.academy/lectures/gravity-jump/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivals.academy/lectures/gravity-jump/</guid><description>&lt;p>Absa has the ability to jump downwards by beginning her double jump on the same frame that her fastfall begins. Combined with her unique double jump momentum and the ability to double jump cancel with her aerials, this allows her to move through the air in unorthodox ways. There are a couple variations of this technique to learn, so let’s take look at how each of these are performed.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first of these is a midair Gravity Jump that can be performed anytime you are able to fastfall. For those of you who don’t know, fastfalling in Rivals of Aether is not an instant action and is delayed until 4 frames after the input is made. Since we need to begin our double jump on the same frame that our fastfall begins, to perform the technique in midair we will need to input our double jump exactly 4 frames after the fastfall input. If done correctly, Absa will begin falling towards the ground with reduced speed and more horizontal control. As this variation requires a frame perfect input, the reliability of the technique is questionable, however the movement it provides has some obvious benefits.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you’d prefer to avoid a frame perfect input however, then you’re in luck! Due to a mechanic related to fastfalls from platform drops, the Gravity Jump is far more easily performed while standing on a platform. Anytime you platform drop you will begin an 8 frame timer. If you are holding down on the last frame of this timer your character will fastfall instantly. By using this timer to force a fastfall, the Gravity Jump becomes far easier to perform, simply drop from the platform and keep down held while you input your double jump. You may input the double jump anytime before the plat-drop timer ends, so long as you are holding down on the 8th frame of the timer, making this version consistent to perform and much easier to use fluidly in your movement. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that beginning your double jump earlier into the timer will cause your momentum in the air to stall slightly more before you start to fall, as the fastfall will always begin on the 8th frame of airtime.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There is one more notable property of the Gravity Jump to learn. Absa’s double jump normally begins by accelerating downwards slightly before quickly rising into the air. As her Gravity Jump reverses this momentum, the technique will cause her to accelerate upwards slightly before travelling downwards. When combined with the delayed fastfall of a platform drop Gravity Jump, you are able to slow your descent enough that you can reliably hit characters standing beside you on a platform from beneath with an instantaneous Up Air before you reach the ground. This can be performed even from some of the lowest platforms in the game. As your Up Air has the same knockback as your Up Strong, this is an extremely powerful mix-up to have at your disposal. Remember to hold the jump button during your aerial to preserve your momentum, as releasing it will instead perform a double jump cancel and will cause you to fall and land before your Up Air becomes active.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our last important lesson is that Absa’s Gravity Jump is also able to restore her double jump, allowing you to use the technique without sacrificing the use of your double jump in the processs. This can allow you to move in unexpected ways and can extend your horizontal reach through the air quite significantly without the risk of being stuck off-stage without one of your most valuable resources. The double jump will be restored 7 frames into the animation, but only if your vertical speed is moving downwards fast enough. This allows you to cancel the animation and instantly input any of your aerial attacks whilst still refreshing your jump, however, moves such as your Up Special and Neutral Special will halt your momentum and prevent it from being restored. This double jump refresh applies to all variations of the Gravity Jump that have been discussed so far, and since you can perform the Gravity Jump in midair this even allows you to refresh your double jump multiple times if performed correctly!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Try testing out the Gravity Jump on stages with different platform layouts, practicing your movement and your aerial control during your attacks. There’s a lot of room for experimentation in how you can use it with Absa’s unique double jump mechanics, but most importantly it’s also pretty fun to play with as well!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Niche Applications of Clone</title><link>https://rivals.academy/lectures/niche-applications-of-clone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivals.academy/lectures/niche-applications-of-clone/</guid><description>&lt;p>These situational tactics are meant for players who are already proficient at using Forsburn&amp;rsquo;s clone, so if you have not already learned to regularly implement cloning for recovery, stalling in the air, and as an edgeguarding tool, then I would recommend that you master those techniques before learning these.

&lt;p>Up Strong 2 is Forsburn&amp;rsquo;s strongest grounded move, but landing it for a kill can be inconsistent at times. Loathe though I am to admit it, there is some truth to the common Forsburn joke “Upcape is RNG” since in most cases the opponent can easily fall out of the first hit of Up Strong by DIing in front of Forsburn (away from the dagger). However, this Clone &amp;gt; Up Strong setup is fairly effective at mixing up the opponent&amp;rsquo;s DI to make the second hit of Up Strong connect. Here is the setup in action:&lt;/p>

video.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>The key to this setup is allowing the clone to move to the other side of your opponent and then popping the opponent towards yourself. Usually when I execute this setup, it&amp;rsquo;s after I have hit the opponent to the edge and they&amp;rsquo;re coming back onstage. When the clone hits them, they&amp;rsquo;re almost always holding in to some degree because they want to get onstage/closer to center stage — if you are facing your opponent with Up Strong then this means they will conveniently be DIing &lt;em>towards&lt;/em> the dagger as shown from the DI lines here:&lt;/p>

video.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>This DI mixup is most effective near the edge when the opponent wants to get back onstage. However, even in the middle of the stage this setup is still difficult to DI correctly since the opponent often isn&amp;rsquo;t prepared to correctly DI both the clone &lt;em>and&lt;/em> the Up Strong. Additionally, the first/back hitbox of Upcape is a true link into the dagger hit so if you&amp;rsquo;re fortunate enough for the clone pop to send the opponent into that hitbox then you&amp;rsquo;ve got an easy confirm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is one of my favorite kill setups and I use it quite a bit due to all the reasons listed above. It takes some experimentation to get under your belt, but is fairly easy to execute once learned and is very rewarding at low risk of overextending. Upcape may be RNG (personally I still don&amp;rsquo;t buy it), but this setup definitely helps to load it in your favor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m sure that most Forsburns do this inadvertently at times, but clone walling is something that I have implemented in my play against certain characters that like to mindlessly throw out or approach with projectiles. Clone walling is simply cloning away from your opponent (so the clone is closer to your opponent) and then running in behind it with a move. If you know that the opponent likes to throw out projectiles willy nilly, this is a great way to approach them with relative safety and catch them by surprise or catch them in their endlag.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this clip, Ranno began the game by charging needles and fired them when he saw me approaching. With clone walling, however, I was able to catch him by surprise and approach unhindered by the projectiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tech won&amp;rsquo;t do your taxes for you, and it&amp;rsquo;s not going to work consistently once your opponent figures out what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, but in a game where each neutral win can lead to a precious combo or stock, this is a great mixup from simply parrying the projectile that can get you that extra neutral win. Below is a particularly deceptive example of this tech — this one worked well because the clone spawned behind my smoke, so I had an additional element of surprise when clone walling in this situation, and it got me the stock.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Elliana&amp;rsquo;s missiles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ori&amp;rsquo;s light orb&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ranno&amp;rsquo;s needles&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Clone walling can also be used defensively against Shovel Knight&amp;rsquo;s SideB and Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s DownB since they have hit detection and stop as soon as they hit something. In both of these cases, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly difficult to convert the clone wall into a neutral win, but it at least prevents you from getting hit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Kragg&amp;rsquo;s rock is not on the list above because it stays active until it touches the ground after hitting the clone. Clone walling can stop the rock from hitting you on the initial throw, but be careful about running in directly behind the clone lest you get hit while the rock is still falling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re like me and have an average (at best) reaction time and consistently tech chasing is difficult, then this technique is for you. Forsburn has a lot of bread and butter combos to get the opponent from low to mid percents, but the opponent will typically start getting more chances to DI out and tech to escape your combos as they get to mid percents. Since the clone&amp;rsquo;s AI is programmed to always follow the opponent (unless you&amp;rsquo;re a maniac and press the Special button again), it has an essentially perfect reaction time and can do the tech chasing for you:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this case the clone didn&amp;rsquo;t have to move since the opponent rolled in, but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to see that the clone would&amp;rsquo;ve been able to chase on any DI and tech option for a reliable follow-up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes the opponent will be able to DI hard out and escape the combo if they have enough room on the stage, but the clone charging at them will still help you press your advantage state despite not having a guaranteed follow-up.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Note: This technique should only be used at mid percents. At low percents, you should be going for different combo options and likely won&amp;rsquo;t have time to get the clone out mid-combo. At high percents, the opponent will be sent offstage or too far away for the clone to be meaningful.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As we all know, ledgeboosting is an essential movement option for Forsburn. The extra speed gained from ledgeboosting as opposed to simply running or wavedashing is very significant. Giving this boost to your clones by spawning them right next to the edge of a platform so that they boost off is a nice way to give a slight mixup to what is ordinarily a rather straightforward AI.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many platforms have a short enough width that your clones will ledgeboost automatically, but learning to space your clones when on platforms so that they ledgeboost is a good habit to get into to give your opponents as little time to react as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, if the opponent is detected to be higher on the stage than the clone, it will perform a ledgeboosted jump.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Making your clone extra speedy in this way will help keep your opponent on their toes because it looks more life-like and it gives them less time to react than a regular clone running along the ground. See non-boosted clone for comparison:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In my opinion, clone is very underutilized by a lot of players so hopefully these four clone tricks will help you up your clone game or even come up with your own applications for Forsburn&amp;rsquo;s trickiest move!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Pityflip</title><link>https://rivals.academy/lectures/the-pityflip/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivals.academy/lectures/the-pityflip/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pityflip is, at its purest, just a wavebounce Dspecial cancelled into the flip. Alongside the flashy tricks, its main purposes are movement and recovery mix ups. Wavebouncing/reversing Dspecial alone is a great way to mix up your landings and platform movement, but the flip makes you that much more mobile and slippery (and cool).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The inputs consist firstly of a Down Special followed by a press of the dodge button to cancel into a flip, but what matters the most is how you turn yourself around with the analog stick. There are a plethora of methods and personal preferences to do this, but my favorite and the easiest way is to perform a quarter circle. Starting with your analog stick facing diagonally downwards towards whatever ledge you wish to slide off of, quickly press dodge to perform the flip cancel and roll your analog stick 90 degrees to the other side, pointed diagonally downwards towards where you started the flip.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Learning the flip this way allows for the pityflip to be initiated whether facing towards or away from ledge. While facing towards, there is no need to start diagonally downwards, as you can just hold down and input the flip to launch the correct way. However when facing away from the stage, the diagonal turns you around first so that you launch towards the edge, while the quarter circle will turn you back around. The reason l say to practice with the diagonal anyways is to build muscle memory and become comfortable performing the tech regardless of which way you are facing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: Nuanced control of your aerial drift, and/or a fastfall input just above ledge can both help you hit the slideoff correctly if the spacing of the flip wasn&amp;rsquo;t perfect.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Spirit Tree and Air Armada are the best stages to practice this on, as you can bounce between the plats with ease. Practice going from one platform to another, but also perform the quarter circles to return to the platform you just came from (flip off of the ones you are facing away from) to get comfortable going both directions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recovering with pityflip, you should be looking to bait an attack from your opponent while you clip the stage and quickly slide off after regaining all of your resources. This allows for an almost immediate reversal, as you have back your double jump, walljump, and air dodge, but you are still in a vulnerable position offstage. As stated before, this option is fundamentally a &lt;strong>mixup&lt;/strong>, as when predicted it can be very easily punished and is not worth it. It is however quite difficult to react to when done right, especially if your opponent isn’t ready for it, so if you use it wisely, it can save you from a lot of hassle recovering with Up B and Down B on repeat.&lt;/p>
