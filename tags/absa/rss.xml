The first main turn-off is that her up tilt can&amp;rsquo;t hit the top platform, which hinders her sharking abilities on both stages. These platform heights can also hinder her movement, since the platforms on both of these stages are very different from the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; platform heights on stages like Tower of Heaven, Frozen Fortress, Fire Capitol, Forest Floor, and many more. As a result, most Absa mains tend to strike these two stages immediately.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Absa has a movement trick that turns Blazing Hideout from a instant ban to a more neutral stage for her. By using a 45° angle with the second zip of her Up Special, she&amp;rsquo;s at the perfect height to waveland on the top platform. This movement trick enhances her platform movement on this stage drastically, and makes Blazing Hideout into yet another stage that Absa can move seamlessly on.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>By using this technique, you can safely pressure the top platform and move across the stage at lightning speed!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also start in the air, hit the ground with your Up Special, and then bounce off the ground at a diagonal angle and still waveland on the top platform. This allows Absa to be able to transition from the air to the top platform quickly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This technique also works with a 135° angle moving backwards, in case you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like overcommitting with your Up Special movement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Despite Absa&amp;rsquo;s up special having two different heights for each zip (the second one is slightly longer), you can still use one diagonal Up Special to get a waveland on Hideout, though it&amp;rsquo;s a bit less smooth and consistent than using Up Special 2. By using her single teleport, you can sneak up to the top platform and enhance her movement even more. If your opponent catches onto you using the horizontal and diagonal approach mentioned earlier, mix them up with just a single teleport to catch them off guard!&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Unlike Blazing Hideout&amp;rsquo;s platform height, the platform height on Aethereal Gates is the perfect height for a single teleport out of a waveland! While regular platforms are a bit too low, and Blazing&amp;rsquo;s is a tiny bit too high to make the one-zip method perfectly smooth, Gates&amp;rsquo;s unique platform heights are perfect for Absa to use a single diagonal teleport to her advantage as a movement option.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Utilizing these tricks, your movement can be refined on stages that were before considered awkward for Absa, and you can continue to pressure the platforms in more creative ways than ever! Pair this with cloud hops, aggressive wavedashes, and smart cloud usage and you can bend the entire stage to your will.&lt;/p>

Combined with her unique double jump momentum and the ability to double jump cancel with her aerials, this allows her to move through the air in unorthodox ways. There are a couple variations of this technique to learn, so let’s take look at how each of these are performed.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first of these is a midair Gravity Jump that can be performed anytime you are able to fastfall. For those of you who don’t know, fastfalling in Rivals of Aether is not an instant action and is delayed until 4 frames after the input is made. Since we need to begin our double jump on the same frame that our fastfall begins, to perform the technique in midair we will need to input our double jump exactly 4 frames after the fastfall input. If done correctly, Absa will begin falling towards the ground with reduced speed and more horizontal control. As this variation requires a frame perfect input, the reliability of the technique is questionable, however the movement it provides has some obvious benefits.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you’d prefer to avoid a frame perfect input however, then you’re in luck! Due to a mechanic related to fastfalls from platform drops, the Gravity Jump is far more easily performed while standing on a platform. Anytime you platform drop you will begin an 8 frame timer. If you are holding down on the last frame of this timer your character will fastfall instantly. By using this timer to force a fastfall, the Gravity Jump becomes far easier to perform, simply drop from the platform and keep down held while you input your double jump. You may input the double jump anytime before the plat-drop timer ends, so long as you are holding down on the 8th frame of the timer, making this version consistent to perform and much easier to use fluidly in your movement. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that beginning your double jump earlier into the timer will cause your momentum in the air to stall slightly more before you start to fall, as the fastfall will always begin on the 8th frame of airtime.&lt;/p>

&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There is one more notable property of the Gravity Jump to learn. Absa’s double jump normally begins by accelerating downwards slightly before quickly rising into the air. As her Gravity Jump reverses this momentum, the technique will cause her to accelerate upwards slightly before travelling downwards. When combined with the delayed fastfall of a platform drop Gravity Jump, you are able to slow your descent enough that you can reliably hit characters standing beside you on a platform from beneath with an instantaneous Up Air before you reach the ground. This can be performed even from some of the lowest platforms in the game. As your Up Air has the same knockback as your Up Strong, this is an extremely powerful mix-up to have at your disposal. Remember to hold the jump button during your aerial to preserve your momentum, as releasing it will instead perform a double jump cancel and will cause you to fall and land before your Up Air becomes active.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our last important lesson is that Absa’s Gravity Jump is also able to restore her double jump, allowing you to use the technique without sacrificing the use of your double jump in the processs. This can allow you to move in unexpected ways and can extend your horizontal reach through the air quite significantly without the risk of being stuck off-stage without one of your most valuable resources. The double jump will be restored 7 frames into the animation, but only if your vertical speed is moving downwards fast enough. This allows you to cancel the animation and instantly input any of your aerial attacks whilst still refreshing your jump, however, moves such as your Up Special and Neutral Special will halt your momentum and prevent it from being restored. This double jump refresh applies to all variations of the Gravity Jump that have been discussed so far, and since you can perform the Gravity Jump in midair this even allows you to refresh your double jump multiple times if performed correctly!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Try testing out the Gravity Jump on stages with different platform layouts, practicing your movement and your aerial control during your attacks. There’s a lot of room for experimentation in how you can use it with Absa’s unique double jump mechanics, but most importantly it’s also pretty fun to play with as well!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
