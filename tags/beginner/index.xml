I will preface this guide by stating my intentions are not to provide optimal combos, but rather provide a general understanding of options that are available to you. An optimal bubble combo is one that follows and reacts to the opponent&amp;rsquo;s bubble drift, so don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to be creative with the combos I have listed below.</description></item></channel></rss>
