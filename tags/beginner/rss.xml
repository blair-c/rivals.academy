The first main turn-off is that her up tilt can&amp;rsquo;t hit the top platform, which hinders her sharking abilities on both stages. These platform heights can also hinder her movement, since the platforms on both of these stages are very different from the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; platform heights on stages like Tower of Heaven, Frozen Fortress, Fire Capitol, Forest Floor, and many more. As a result, most Absa mains tend to strike these two stages immediately.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Absa has a movement trick that turns Blazing Hideout from a instant ban to a more neutral stage for her. By using a 45° angle with the second zip of her Up Special, she&amp;rsquo;s at the perfect height to waveland on the top platform. This movement trick enhances her platform movement on this stage drastically, and makes Blazing Hideout into yet another stage that Absa can move seamlessly on.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>By using this technique, you can safely pressure the top platform and move across the stage at lightning speed!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also start in the air, hit the ground with your Up Special, and then bounce off the ground at a diagonal angle and still waveland on the top platform. This allows Absa to be able to transition from the air to the top platform quickly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Despite Absa&amp;rsquo;s up special having two different heights for each zip (the second one is slightly longer), you can still use one diagonal Up Special to get a waveland on Hideout, though it&amp;rsquo;s a bit less smooth and consistent than using Up Special 2. By using her single teleport, you can sneak up to the top platform and enhance her movement even more. If your opponent catches onto you using the horizontal and diagonal approach mentioned earlier, mix them up with just a single teleport to catch them off guard!&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Unlike Blazing Hideout&amp;rsquo;s platform height, the platform height on Aethereal Gates is the perfect height for a single teleport out of a waveland! While regular platforms are a bit too low, and Blazing&amp;rsquo;s is a tiny bit too high to make the one-zip method perfectly smooth, Gates&amp;rsquo;s unique platform heights are perfect for Absa to use a single diagonal teleport to her advantage as a movement option.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Utilizing these tricks, your movement can be refined on stages that were before considered awkward for Absa, and you can continue to pressure the platforms in more creative ways than ever! Pair this with cloud hops, aggressive wavedashes, and smart cloud usage and you can bend the entire stage to your will.&lt;/p>

This amount will always be &lt;strong>17 times&lt;/strong> the amount of damage that is dealt, with the gems that spawn randomly selected to make up the sum of this value. The gems are collectable for 240-260 frames each, with larger value gems fading away later than smaller valued gems.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once you amass enough gems you’ll be able to spend it using Shovel Knight’s taunt, summoning Chester and allowing you to browse the various relics and armors he has on offer. The relics will replace your Neutral Special with a new attack and the armors grant you new abilities or stats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A significant feature of the shop is that you are able to quickly purchase relics and armors using the right stick!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Left&lt;/strong> will purchase the &lt;strong>War Horn&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Up&lt;/strong> will purchase the &lt;strong>Mobile Gear&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Down&lt;/strong> will purchase &lt;strong>Dynamo Mail&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Right&lt;/strong> will purchase &lt;strong>Mail of Momentum&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Since this currency system is such an important part of Shovel Knight’s playstyle, with the relics and armours greatly impacting how you will play each game, it’s important to understand the values of each gem and item. The below image shows the value of each gem and item, as well as the values for an Up Strong Rock, Down Special&amp;rsquo;s Treasure Pile, and the Golden Troupple Fish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="values.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is one more source of gems however…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="money-bags.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On dying, Shovel Knight will lose 25% of his total savings, with this amount being split between three different valued bags. One bag will always contain half of this amount, a second bag will contain a third and the final bag will contain only a sixth of the total spawned on death. These bags are collectable for a total of 600 frames, however after 300 frames they can be nabbed up by your opponent, so make sure to recover your lost goods before they’re snatched up! As there are three different sized bags that can spawn, prioritize those larger bags and start saving towards your next big purchase!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s all for today, class dismissed!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Elli Up Tilt Mechanics and Mixups</title><link>https://rivals.academy/lectures/elli-uptilt-mechanics-and-mixups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rivals.academy/lectures/elli-uptilt-mechanics-and-mixups/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Up Tilt is a move with relatively weak knockback at its base, but built-up heat can be expended to empower the move. Up Tilt’s knockback increases linearly based on how much heat is expended, from 7 base + 60 scaling with no heat to 9 base + 90 scaling at overheat, and its endlag on hit from 10 frames with no heat to 20 frames at overheat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Up Tilt is a move with a multitude of mixups, but even without them the move is still very powerful. Overheat Up Tilt can kill confirm into Missile &amp;gt; Nair or almost any of Elli’s other deadly combos, or just outright kill. However, there are certain percent windows (which vary greatly depending on stage, character, and positioning) where a high heat Up Tilt may not be easy to convert off of while not killing outright either, and this is where our mixups become especially useful.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>By holding the parry button as you release the opponent, you can retain all heat, and consequently lower the move’s knockback and endlag significantly (depending on how much heat you currently have). &lt;strong>This is a completely unreactable DI mixup.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Once your opponent hits mid percents, they typically have no choice but to DI in on high heat Up Tilt at ledge unless they make a hard read on your heat retain, which is a risk immensely stacked in your favour (especially since if they read you correctly and DI out, they’re still offstage versus one of the best edgeguarders in the game). As such, it ends up being very easy to confirm heat retain Up Tilt into an overheat strong attack, and depending on the percent any of the three strongs can be applied. This can net you kills in situations where you may not otherwise be able to secure the stock.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Additionally, Up Tilt can be turned around by inputting the opposite direction before the opponent is swallowed by Elli’s mech. &lt;strong>This is a reactable DI mixup, with a 23 frame animation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While not nearly as potent a mixup, turning around your Up Tilt to send the opponent to the opposite side of the stage can also function as a lethal DI check and keep your opponent on their toes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Orcane&amp;rsquo;s Fair is a bit like a special move, with a lot of unique properties. Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about how to use it. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about everything from the absolute basics to some more in-depth stuff. Let&amp;rsquo;s get into it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First of all, it&amp;rsquo;s very important that you input Fair with the right control stick. This gives you maximum control over your aerial drift. If you use keyboard controls, you can bind left/right RS buttons for the same effect.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In addition to the bubbles, you have the &amp;ldquo;Bubblebutt.&amp;rdquo; The Bubblebutt hitbox will only appear if you&amp;rsquo;re moving (&amp;gt;4px/frame) during Fair. It won&amp;rsquo;t appear if you&amp;rsquo;re not moving.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Orcane&amp;rsquo;s Fair is also great for recovering. You can use it to stall aerially offstage because you don&amp;rsquo;t lose too much height when you use it, but you can also use it to quickly propel yourself back to stage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This technique is a little niche. I call it &amp;ldquo;The 1Bub.&amp;rdquo; This is where you autocancel your Forward Air so that only one tick of bubbles appears. You can tell that you did it right if you don&amp;rsquo;t hear a sound effect, and you will only see two bubbles appear.&lt;/p>

I will preface this guide by stating my intentions are not to provide optimal combos, but rather provide a general understanding of options that are available to you. An optimal bubble combo is one that follows and reacts to the opponent&amp;rsquo;s bubble drift, so don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to be creative with the combos I have listed below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fair Spike &amp;gt; Up Air 1 &amp;gt; Bair&lt;/strong> (27%)&lt;br>
Fair Spike &amp;gt; Up Air 1 (Hitfall the first hit of Up Air) &amp;gt; Bair provides solid damage and has the added benefit of being a DI mixup. Depending on how you position yourself after the Up Air 1, you can either opt for sweetspot Bair and hopefully catch your opponent holding out or the Reverse Hit for the possibility of a combo extender.&lt;/p>

Reverse Bair &amp;gt; Reverse Bair &amp;gt; DACUS is a simple combo that provides a very generous amount of damage and adds an additional two stacks onto your opponent.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Reverse Bair &amp;gt; Dash Attack &amp;gt; Up Air 1 &amp;gt; Bair&lt;/strong> (30%)&lt;br>
Compared to the combos listed above, this will be more towards the harder end of &amp;ldquo;basic&amp;rdquo;; borderline intermediate. Instead of going for Fair, as shown in Basic Combo 3, you can instead alter the route into a string of Up Air 1s leading into a Bair, Nair, or Fair finisher. Do remember that the opponent is able to escape Up Air 1 strings with either an airdodge or a Jump.&lt;/p>

For a slight increase in difficulty, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to achieve similar results as the above combo but with an additional 3% added to your opponent. The slight increase in difficulty comes from the fact that you must perform a dash prior to the falling Up Air.&lt;/p>

Depending on how close you are to your opponent after the Neutral Special, you can very well combo into Jab and from there tilt cancel. So even though this string does the least amount of damage in this category, it provides the most potential for versatility.&lt;/p>

While the moves used are pretty basic, its very important that you perform a slight dash after each Bair or else the opponent will be too far to follow up. Once rising needle throw is over, make sure you&amp;rsquo;re able to get out falling Bair as soon as possible to prevent the opponent from teching.&lt;/p>

The classic go-to kill option that does its job very well in a multitude of situations. Please note that during kill range, this combo is very much avoidable by Di-ing down then immediately up, but the difficulty of such DI allows it to land far more often then it should.&lt;/p>

Ranno&amp;rsquo;s Forward Strong is probably the move most players wouldnt expect him to opt for in terms of bubble options. It&amp;rsquo;ll add a nice mix up to your repertoire and is great on stages with average to below-average side blastzones such as Rock Wall and Air Armada.&lt;/p>

Because of how freeform Wrastor can be played, this guide is more focused on explaining the strategy and concepts. As such, other Wrastor players may have their own approaches to the character but I believe the information here is general enough to be applicable by anyone. This guide is not intended to be all-encompassing; there are many more aspects of Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s game to explore beyond what I write about here.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most common strategy employed in neutral by Wrastor players is known as &amp;ldquo;bait and punish&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;whiff punish.&amp;rdquo; Rather than rushdown, chip away at opponents, or dominate stage control, Wrastor instead seeks to access his explosive punish game while avoiding any unnecessary damage in the most effective way possible. The strategy works as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s high horizontal speed in Slipstream and/or multiple jumps to enter your opponent&amp;rsquo;s attack range, baiting them into attacking you&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Preemptively move away to avoid the attack&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Punish the endlag of their whiffed attack and begin your combo&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This strategy is universal to fighting games, but Wrastors utilize it heavily for a few main reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wrastor has fast movement and quick high ranged melee attacks, both making the technique easier&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wrastor is so light that trading is almost never in his favor— he wants clean openings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wrastor relies on extended combos to kill— he does not have effective tools to apply stage control or chip damage from afar&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Slipstream, Wrastor gains access to some of the fastest and most versatile grounded movement in the game. Utilize your increased speed with dash dancing, wavedashing, and even moonwalking to maintain tricky movement and capitalize when your opponent slips up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to space tilts on the ground, characters must normally either wavedash, babydash, walk, or run-cancel (crouch), all of which have their benefits and drawbacks. Wavedashing and run-cancelling require commitments of 6 and 16 frames respectively, while walking is very slow, and babydashing is challenging to be consistent with. However, due to an interesting quirk regarding his strongs only being usable in the air, Wrastor has the powerful ability to cancel his initial dash with a tilt at any time simply by inputting the tilt with strong rather than attack, allowing for quick, precise, and easy to execute adjustments to your grounded spacing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A common whiff punish situation is baiting aerials from below. Since Wrastor lacks a good anti-air, if you anticipate one coming you can move out of the way and punish the landing lag instead of parrying/rolling, which are more committal and can be intentionally baited. Note that different characters will have different landing lag values.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s very high horizontal aerial mobility in Slipstream, combined with having access to 3 midair jumps, grants him unparallelled ability to feign attacks from above and bait his opponent into committing to a punishable anti-air or defensive option. Drifting in and back out of their range is very effective, especially in Slipstream.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Another consideration is move choice. Generally you&amp;rsquo;re looking to get in with moves that are a good combination of:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Disjointed (hitbox extends past hurtbox), typically also implies high range&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fast startup and/or low endlag/FAF&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Long hitbox duration relative to the total move&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If I had to rank Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s moves in terms of their utility in neutral:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>S&lt;/strong>: Bair, Dtilt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A&lt;/strong>: Dash Attack, Jab, Nair, Slipstream (projectile), Fair&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>B&lt;/strong>: Up Air, Dair, Dtilt, Down Special&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>F&lt;/strong>: Everything else&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now all this isn&amp;rsquo;t to say this is the only effective neutral strategy. Mixing in raw approaches or some occasional chip-damage play keeps the opponent on their toes, especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve proven to them you can bait and punish so effectively that it makes them attack shy, giving you easy openings. Make sure to experiment and look to combine this neutral strategy with the upcoming punish game strategies and you&amp;rsquo;ll be well on your way to winning more games with the bird.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Consider the phrase “&lt;strong>With Wrastor, everything is possible, but nothing is guaranteed.&lt;/strong>” Rather than rely on a few consistent kill confirms, Wrastor instead has access to over 200 potential ways to set up for a kill, as every single one of his normals can combo into any of his kill moves given the right conditions. As such, a common strategy birds employ is one of positional advantage. After tacking on some damage, look to combo your opponent towards a blastzone where you can either bait or outright force certain DI that you&amp;rsquo;re ready for, enabling you to land the killing blow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All of your aerials can link into Forward Strong on the right DI. Sweetspot Up Special can replace it as it has similar strength (but different spacing), but it carries more risk. ~43% of Wrastor kills from &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18c7od0wON5htoKAXrdSFzmAy3B92KkhRy21s6n-aQeI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my study&lt;/a> were from Fstrong, so it should be your primary kill option.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Look for Up Strong, rising Neutral Special, and Up Special.

&lt;p>Wrastor has endless combinations for combos, and can be played extremely freeform. Every Wrastor ends up developing their own combo style. But despite our best intentions, mistakes will happen and we’ll often be left with an opponent at mid-high%s in neutral. &lt;strong>Once most characters get past 80-100% or so, many of Wrastor’s aerial confirms stop working as well&lt;/strong> and need the right setup and/or DI. In this situation, throwing out raw claps is an easy way to get yourself punished; Instead you’ll want to use moves that are safer to throw out and can combo better at a variety of %s, aiming to react to their DI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best mid-high% confirms for this include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dtilt &amp;gt; Clap&lt;/strong>. Up Strong will usually kill earlier, but Fstrong works better to catch DI out, which will be easier if Slipstream is already out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dash Attack (off plat) &amp;gt; Clap&lt;/strong>. This combo works at nearly any % and is usually very reactable due to the low endlag and preservation of momentum the move offers. Grounded dash attack can also work, but is laggier.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Down Special &amp;gt; Clap&lt;/strong>. This works best if you already have Slipstream out. If you can’t reach them, this move will force a techchase in almost any circumstance.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Here I set a bot to 130% with random DI and react to land the clap. You can also use Sweetspot Up Special in place of Clap, but it can be tougher to land.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are plenty more options to consider here, but they are not as universal or as easy to set up as the above, often requiring a parry to set up or convenient DI to land. These include Up Tilt Spike &amp;gt; Clap and Jab 3 &amp;gt; Clap. Speaking of parry punishes, most Wrastors will just use raw Up Special (or run through Up Special), which can be countered by DI up. But by using one of the options discussed here instead, you can call out that DI up/in with a combo move, setting up for an easy Clap or Up Special that will kill earlier than the raw Up Special would have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If they really start getting to high %s (&amp;gt;130%) you can attempt to land &lt;strong>stray hits&lt;/strong> such as early bair, which due to its high knockback growth can outright kill with DI in from plats or often set up for a Sour Up Special near the top.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>Similarly, an Early Nair 2 can throw them off the side without the endlag of a Clap if you whiff. Dair spike will also start outright killing here, you just need them to be above ledge or offstage (or miss the tech).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you continue to play, experiment with different combo options and kill setups to find your own way of accomplishing things. As you gain experience with Wrastor and get familiar with his kit you can keep adding options to your arsenal to help answer any defensive strategy the opponent may throw your way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the first major guidelines players often abide by is “DI out to escape combos, DI in to survive kill moves”. So as Wrastor, let&amp;rsquo;s explore ways we can counter that strategy and maintain that positional advantage we discussed above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing to know is that being in Slipstream generally gives Wrastor the ability to cover DI out if you can maintain your momentum. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the basic scenario where they&amp;rsquo;re in front of you at low-mid% and you&amp;rsquo;re moving to the right. Here your main three combo tools will be Up Air, Fair, and Nair, which cover a good range of angles. The goal is to keep them within your melee attack range, but continue to push them sideways so you can maintain your momentum.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you think they&amp;rsquo;ll hold out (→), use Up Air (75°) or Inner Fair (60°) to keep them close.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you think they&amp;rsquo;ll hold in (←), use Nair (30° + 45°) or Tipper Fair (40°) to push them outwards.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Blend these together and switch between them based on your opponent&amp;rsquo;s actions. Land a few of these, and they&amp;rsquo;ll be offstage where you can set up to finish the stock. Pictured below are the zones where these moves can send vs. Zetter at 50%, with the main dotted path showing no DI or drift.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="example.png" alt="Graphic displaying the ranges a Zetterburn at 50% can be sent by Wrastor Up Air 1, Inner Fair, and Nair">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re the one getting comboed by Wrastor in Slipstream, you want to leave that zone. Your options include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Holding in the first few hits to shift yourself up and disrupt his momentum, giving you better odds at escape&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you&amp;rsquo;re near stage, hold hard down/out to get low and try to land a tech&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DI to the nearest platform and look to tech or use a grounded wakeup option&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now, what if we&amp;rsquo;re in the same position, but without access to Slipstream? Even an Up Air may not keep them close enough vs. DI out, especially if our rightward momentum has been disrupted. You could try an early Fstrong or Up Special and send them flying sideways, but if they hold in, it probably won&amp;rsquo;t kill. Here we can consider using the greatest mix up tool in the game: &lt;strong>Dair&lt;/strong>. Unlike most moves that push up and/or away, Dair will instead throw them &lt;em>across&lt;/em> Wrastor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="dair.png" alt="Graphic demonstrating that Dair sends across Wrastor">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dair is absurdly powerful for combos. Normally, DI out/down lets people escape once they&amp;rsquo;re in front of you, so the main mix up most characterss have is simply whether they use a combo move (like Fair) or kill move (like Fstrong/Up Special), but Dair gives us a 3rd option: throw them backwards, keeping them close for follow up and allowing you to continue the combo upwards instead. This lets you choose between setting up an edgeguard vs. juggling them for more damage. The best counterplay to avoid this mixup is to DI straight down, but this can be risky as it does almost nothing vs. Up Air and is also very poor DI on Fstrong/Up Special.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Dair also provides another useful function, arguably more important than the first. Say they unexpectedly held in and you&amp;rsquo;ve overshot your position— they&amp;rsquo;re behind you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="example-overshoot.png" alt="Graphic displaying the ranges a Zetterburn at 50% behind Wrastor can be sent by Early Bair, Up Air 3, and Dair">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we have a similar scenario to last time, except it&amp;rsquo;s even worse due to our momentum being in the wrong direction (headed right, but need to chase left). Even with Slipstream speed and a vertical move like Up Air 3, if they hold out (←) we may not be able to shift momentum in time. Dair rescues us again here. The back hit brings them in front of or above us, letting us combo and adjust for overshoot.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s consider a scenario where their DI got the better of you: they screwed up your momentum and are just outside of melee range. Here, we can consider &lt;strong>throwing the Slipstream projectile itself to attempt to keep the combo going&lt;/strong>. It barely has any hitstun, but can interrupt your opponent&amp;rsquo;s momentum and/or attack startup and give you a brief window to combo. Plus, now you have Slipstream active, which lets you follow up on DI out if they try it again.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>This technique comes with a huge caveat, however: &lt;strong>followups off of Slipstream are almost never true&lt;/strong>. Even with optimal spacing, if Slipstream hits the front of their hurtbox it can always be airdodged out of or often countered by fast attacks. While it is difficult to react to, experienced opponents may be aware of this scenario and be ready to break out. Balancing the risk/reward of combo extensions is an essential Wrastor skill that comes with time, so experiment and model your playstyle accordingly.&lt;/p>

&lt;/button>
&lt;span class="copied">Copied link!&lt;/span>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>While Slipstream and Dair are both incredibly powerful tools, remember that Wrastor can still utilize traditional mixups, namely choosing when to use a strong attack vs. a weak combo tool. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve been landing Dash Attack -&amp;gt; Fstrong, so they hold in to survive. Instead, you can go for an Up Air/Fair off the Dash Attack, which on DI in should set up nicely for an Up Strong off the top. Getting a feel for making these decisions is another important skill for Wrastor players to develop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This analysis has dealt mainly with aerial-based combos, but do not neglect his grounded options! Using platform movement to combine aerial + grounded attacks is very powerful, but has more factors going on that are tougher to boil down. The same theory applies however: use moves that compliment your momentum and the situation at hand. Mixing in Dash Attacks is highly effective since it also serves as movement. Dtilt can be used as a standard combo tool that keeps them closer. Ftilt and Jab can serve as good pace-breakers and help to stop their momentum. Up Tilt can be used to push them offstage. DownB is tricky to land during combos but can be a useful reset tool. In short, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to use Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s wavelanding ability and grounded options to extend his combos in more unique ways instead of relying solely on aerial juggles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With all that said, I hope this guide served as a healthy introduction to Wrastor&amp;rsquo;s gameplan. He packs the most freeform combos in an already freeform game, so be sure to practice and experiment. Now go land some combos.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
