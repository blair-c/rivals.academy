# rivals.academy

Official website and API of Rivals Academy. Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Contributing

### Development

[Install Hugo (Extended)](https://gohugo.io/installation/)  
Fetch source code and start live preview on `localhost`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blair-c/rivals.academy.git
cd rivals.academy
hugo server --minify
```

>Live preview often requires a `CTRL+Shift+R` / `CMD+Shift+R` browser refresh for CSS changes, and a full restart for content file deletions/renames.

>Many images including [Library](https://rivals.academy/library) hitbox images are scaled via GitHub Actions at build, and so changes to them won't display on site pages during development.
