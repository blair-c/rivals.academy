    - Retains a hitbox until landed, spikes while falling.
  notes:
  - Spawns only if Up Strong is fully charged (while on the ground).
  - Can angle the initial arc on creation by holding a horizontal direction.

    notes:

  notes:
  - If airborne, frames 16 and 17 will stall when reaching the ground and prevent you from landing until frame 18.
  - Landing anytime from frame 18 onwards during the remaining frames of endlag will cause you to immediately cancel into default landing lag.

  notes:

    notes:
    - Must be idle for 20 frames before you can reel in a treasure.
    - After idling with the anchor on the ground for 180 frames the anchor will automatically reel in.
    - On catch, reel f1-12 for a Golden Troupple Fish, f13-16 for a treasure pile.					
  notes:
  - You can only down-special once per airtime.
  - Anchor will continue travelling during hitpause. 
  - Hitbox detection is active while travelling, however the hitbox itself only becomes active on hitting a character and the anchor cannot otherwise break projectiles.

    notes:
    - Can hit the same character once every 10 frames.
    - Becomes inactive on landing.
  notes:
  - Reeling in from frame 13 of a catch onwards will result in a Treasure Pile.
  - Treasure Pile has 20 health in total and reduces in size slightly every 4 damage that's dealt to it.
  - Only one treasure pile can be active at once, and reeling in a new one will cause the previous one to disappear.
