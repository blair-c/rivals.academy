  - Up Air will loop hit 1 up to 4 times while holding attack. This allows you to delay the final hit, connect hit 1 multiple times and will lift Shovel Knight into the air.
  - Dagger hilt has higher knockback than the tip.

When hitting another character or object, Shovel Knight will bounce and Dair will remain active for a further 11 frames before you are able to begin the endlag state.

    - Retains a hitbox until landed, spikes while falling.
  notes:
  - Spawns only if Up Strong is fully charged (while on the ground).
  - Can angle the initial arc on creation by holding a horizontal direction.

    notes:
    - Infinidagger is locked in if special is held until the 96th frame of startup, which immediately starts the 2 frame startup window before releasing.
    - Travels much faster than partially charging forward-special.
  notes:
  - Holding down on any actionable frame during either the hit/bounce animation or during jump-cancel's momentum will cancel the animation and slow Shovel Knight's aerial momentum to his usual amount.
  - Holding back on the same frame you jump-cancel will cause Shovel Knight to turnaround on the first frame of jump-squat, allowing him to face the opposite direction in the air.
  - A 30 frame cooldown applies on the final frame of endlag if you are in the air on whiff. On hit or after bouncing all versions of Forward Special will apply a 40 frame cooldown on the first frame of endlag, which is effectively a 29 frame cooldown once you are actionable.

    notes:
    - Must be idle for 20 frames before you can reel in a treasure.
    - After idling with the anchor on the ground for 180 frames the anchor will automatically reel in.
    - On catch, reel f1-12 for a Golden Troupple Fish, f13-16 for a treasure pile.					
  notes:
  - You can only down-special once per airtime.
  - Anchor will continue travelling during hitpause. 
  - Hitbox detection is active while travelling, however the hitbox itself only becomes active on hitting a character and the anchor cannot otherwise break projectiles.

    notes:
    - Can hit the same character once every 10 frames.
    - Becomes inactive on landing.
  notes:
  - Reeling in from frame 13 of a catch onwards will result in a Treasure Pile.
  - Treaure Pile will remain onscreen for 600 frames, the timer for which begins immediately on beginning to reel it in. This 600 frame lifetime resets upon hitting it, reducing it in size if the rock has not been destroyed.
  - Treasure Pile has 20 health in total and reduces in size slightly every 4 damage that's dealt to it.
  - Only one treasure pile can be active at once, and reeling in a new one will cause the previous one to disappear.
