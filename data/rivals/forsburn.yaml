      active: 126
    firstActiveFrame: 20
    notes:
    - Releases 5-10 clouds of smoke unless interrupted by Forsburn being hit (barring flinch) or performing another special, both of which cause all smoke to become active.
    - During each release interval if Forsburn is within a patch of smoke it will skip that cycle and guarantee that the next interval will spawn smoke instead, with the exception of the second interval which always spawns smoke.

      frame: 10
    firstActiveFrame: 20
    notes:
    - Interrupting Forsburn before frame 10 will cause him to lose his smoke charges and not release any smoke.
  notes:
  - There can be a maximum of 20 smoke clouds shared by all Forsburns at once in a given game, with new clouds of smoke removing the oldest active smoke cloud.
  - Active smoke hides Forsburn's movements whenever he is not attacking, allows him to create a clone or teleport into it silently and invisibly, and is consumable with down-special.
  - Active smoke can also be destroyed by enemy characters. Upon being destroyed, smoke remains active for 12 frames before disappearing.
  - Inactive smoke does not conceal the player and cannot be destroyed or interacted with in any way.
  - Forsburn's neutral special will be disabled if there is inactive smoke or an active clone in play.

    notes:
    - Clone will be removed 14 frames after active frames have ended, after which  cooldown will begin.
  notes:
  - A single cloud of smoke is created upon hitting and destroying clone.
  - Clone is instantly destroyed upon hitting Forsburn.
  - Pressing neutral or side special while clone is active toggles between Attack and Evade movement patterns.
  - Holding special after spawning a clone will prevent him from jumping, walljumping or using Up Special. On releasing special, the clone will double jump, walljump or Up Special 10 frames later.
  - If the clone has their Up Special parried it will disappear immediately without leaving a smoke cloud.
  - Creating a clone whilst hiding behind smoke will not play an audio cue.
  - The cooldown indicator will remain active on creating a clone and will only become inactive on the clone being destroyed or after clone combust has been commanded.

  notes:
  - A single cloud of smoke is created upon hitting and destroying clone.
  - Clone is instantly destroyed upon hitting Forsburn.
  - Pressing neutral or side special while super clone is active commands him to attack.
  - Clone will automatically attack 120 frames from FAF of previous attack.
  - Super clone's movement is always in attack mode, unless its target is invincible, in which case it will swap to evade mode for the duration of the opposing characters invulnerability and you will be unable to command it to attack.
  - Holding special after spawning a clone will prevent him from jumping, walljumping or using Up Special. On releasing special, the clone will double jump, walljump or Up Special 10 frames later.
  - If the clone has their Up Special parried it will disappear immediately without leaving a smoke cloud.

    notes:
    - Landing immediately out of up-special increases the pratfall landing lag time, causing Forsburn to remain in grounded landing lag for 20 frames after 8 frames of endlag from the teleport. If airborne, Forsburn can control his aerial drift from frame 58 and has a decreased pratfall landing lag value of 10, which make landing directly from the teleport slower than ending Up Special in the air in some circumstances.
