  - Knockback is increased on hitting an active mine, conveyed visually by a red explosion animation rather than the regular orange one.

    - Mine takes 100 frames to become active if stuck on a player.
  notes:
  - Can be hit away by attacks and projectiles while active. The speed and angle in which the mine will travel upon being hit in mid-air is relative to the base knockback and knockback angle of the attack.
  - Mine will automatically explode when hitting certain articles. These include Sylvanos' Flowers, Vince (Pomme), Ranno's Bubble and Olympia's Crystal.
  - Mine will not stick to the last person to hit it and cannot be stuck to Elliana.
