Orcane's Fair is a bit like a special move, with a lot of unique properties. Today we're going to talk about how to use it. We'll talk about everything from the absolute basics to some more in-depth stuff. Let's get into it.

## Basic Control

First of all, it's very important that you input Fair with the right control stick. This gives you maximum control over your aerial drift. If you use keyboard controls, you can bind left/right RS buttons for the same effect.

Just as important, it also gives you control over how your bubbles drift. By tilting the left stick up or down, you can slightly control the direction your bubbles drift to.

All of this control is only possible if you don't use the button to input Forward Air. So, don't.

## Bubblebutt

In addition to the bubbles, you have the "Bubblebutt." The Bubblebutt hitbox will only appear if you're moving (>4px/frame) during Fair. It won't appear if you're not moving.

The knockback power of this move is dependent on how fast you're going, which makes it a great kill option to chase down aerial opponents.

Just be careful you don't go *too* deep and SD.

## Recovery

Orcane's Fair is also great for recovering. You can use it to stall aerially offstage because you don't lose too much height when you use it, but you can also use it to quickly propel yourself back to stage.

## Bonus Tech

This technique is a little niche. I call it "The 1Bub." This is where you autocancel your Forward Air so that only one tick of bubbles appears. You can tell that you did it right if you don't hear a sound effect, and you will only see two bubbles appear.

That's all I've got for you today, I hope this has demystified Orcane's Fair a bit and will give you the confidence to continue learning!
