Zetterburn's Shine > Up Strong is one of the strongest kill options in the game as it is almost always applicable for a parry punish and is a follow up off of a frame 2 move (Shine) that can also be used to whiff punish effectively. Performed correctly, it's a true confirm on the entire cast well into Up Strong kill %.

Note: Some players may find it helpful to bind one or more buttons used for this technique (special, jump, strong) to a spare shoulder button.

## How To

Shine > Up Strong is performed by using a Shine from an initial dash so that you slide forward while the Shine connects. From this, jump cancel out of the Shine, then use that to do a jump canceled Up Strong during your jump squat.

## Breaking It Down

Start by getting comfortable by Shining back and forth from initial dash.

Next, make sure you're comfortable jump canceling out of Shine.

Now input Up Strong during the jump squat of your jump cancel.

Now all that's left is to put it all together!

There are two commons issue many have. First is that they fireball instead of getting the sliding shine. If this happens, you are holding the direction on your stick for too long which causes a side input to be read. Make sure that this stick returns to a neutral position to avoid those costly fireballs. 

The second issue is an Up Special in place. This is caused by pressing jump too soon in the sequence which causes your Shine + Up Strong to be read as an Up Special since you are pressing special and up at the same time. Make sure that you are making your inputs in the order of Dash > Shine > Jump > Up Strong, and return to practicing each part individually if you find yourself struggling.
