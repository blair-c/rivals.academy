## Why Ledgedash?

First, what is a ledgedash? Ledgedashing is teching the corner of the stage wall after a hit and quickly wavelanding onto stage while you still have invincibility. Ledgedashing can be a useful tool for recovery and a possible reversal when being edgeguarded, and we've seen it become increasingly prominent in Rivals' meta over the past few years.

## How To

The inputs are pretty simple: simply press tech/dodge twice while holding in the direction of the stage. **You do not need to use your double jump.** The hard part is getting the timing and height correct. If you mash the dodge button, you might go into lockout and won’t be able to tech, and if you aren’t high enough when hit you might not get the waveland on stage.

When first starting out, it might be easier to hold down and toward the stage to get the waveland. This will also help with the different timings you might need to get a ledgedash. Although you don’t need to use your double jump, if you go too low you can use it to cancel the tech animation early to give the options of walltech > dj > ledgedash, or walltech > dj > invincible aerial.

## Application

When practicing, it’s important to figure out which moves are best to use out of ledgedash. Not every move is 100% safe to use and can be punished if your opponent reacts to it.

If you're looking to gain an edge over your opponents, ledgedashing is a tool highly worth adding to your arsenal.
