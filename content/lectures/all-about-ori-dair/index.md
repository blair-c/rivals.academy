Ori Dair on the surface seems quite linear, but with clever usage of hitfalling and calculated risk, it can lead into some dangerous confirms and net you some early and satisfying kills.

## Hitfall Kills Onstage

While onstage, you have access to strong attacks, and coupled with Dair's hefty hitstun, you have access to stable setups into your strongs.

### Dair > Fstrong

While many of Ori's kill setups require DI reads or guessing, Dair > Fstrong can be done on reaction. With Dair's heavy hitstun, you have the freedom of being able to follow DI without any problems.

Be ready to follow them if they DI towards nearby platforms.

Even on extreme levels of DI, SDI and drift, you can still catch them with an Fstrong, although at this level of DI the timing is very tight, and closer to a read than an actual setup.

### Dair > Up Strong

Speaking of reads, Dair > Up Strong is exactly that, a read that can net you kill earlier than an Fstrong, at the cost of certainty.

However, due to the laggy nature of Up Strong, you will have to pick a single option to cover, which overall makes this option potent, but somewhat unreliable.

## Hitfall Kills Offstage

Considerations for the following setups:  
- As with all moves fastfell offstage, you will be falling incredibly quick, don’t try to hit these setups if you are too close to the bottom blastzone, which will result in an SD.  
- I will be detailing these setups on DI in. If your opponent is DIing Dair out, you must follow them accordingly, or you will SD.

### Dair > Bair

While seemingly being a little extra, Dair > Bair sometimes gives that little boost of % needed to get a kill off the side blastzone.

### Dair > Bash

The scariest, riskiest, most satisfying thing to hit: Dair > Bash. This setup is the pinnacle of early kills, closing stocks at ridiculously low %s.

An aspect unique to this setup is your position when going for the initial Dair. For lower %s, you should always aim to be above your opponent when landing the Dair, as being too low or inside of them will cause you to plummet below them, into an SD. At higher %s, you have flexibility as to where your initial Dair lands, but if possible, it’s the best option to always try to hit the Dair above. This setup will start to connect around 60% on the entire cast.

The nature of Ori revolves around having less set in stone kill confirms, so while fishing for them is a good way to lose stocks,  having access to this list of consistent kill confirms out of Dair is still key to keep in mind.

## Whiffed Dair Saves

On stages where the bottom blastzone is **412 pixels** deep or larger, you can **runoff Dair** and still have the means to make it back to stage.
The stages you can do this on are, in order of easiest to hardest to make it back:
- Fire Capital
- Endless Abyss
- Troupple Pond
- Air Armada*

*On Air Armada, you will need to double jump first in order to make it back to stage after a whiffed Dair.

If you add in a **shorthop** offstage before the Dair, you can survive on stages with **396 pixels** deep or larger.
This adds these stages to the list, in the same order:
- Tempest Peak
- Julesvale
- Rock Wall
- Frozen Fortress

Futhermore, if you add in a **fullhop** before the Dair, you can now survive a whiff on any stage, including the stage with the smallest bottom blastzone of **368 pixels**, Treetop Lodge.

Happy Dairing!
