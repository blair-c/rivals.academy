{{< yt title="Character Overviews - Rivals of Aether: The Competitive Smash Player's Guide" id="Hb6APRdNNag" >}}

In this guide, we’re going to answer the classic new fighting game player question of "Who should I play?"

To help you answer this question, I’ll provide a brief rundown of what each character offers: going over their unique abilities, strategies they’re a good fit for, general strengths and weaknesses they may have, and other key facts.

I’m not going to be addressing competitive viability or tier list placement anywhere in this guide for a few reasons:
- Firstly, for new players, I'd recommend that you play a character that you resonate with so that you want to actually play and learn the game, and picking a character purely because some stranger on the Internet told you that they’re “the strongest” probably isn’t the healthiest way to learn any fighting game, and it can really warp your expectations if you're not handling them correctly.
- Secondly, everyone is good enough to be viable anyway in this game so it’s kind of a moot point. The game is generally pretty well balanced and anybody can succeed with any character. You can take a look at the most recent RCS rankings and see just how much representation there is across the whole roster:

- ![Top 50 character representation graphic by @PantchToGo](img/top-50.jpeg)

In other words: you won’t be holding yourself back because of your character choice, so just pick whatever sounds most appealing. Without any further ado, let’s get started!

## Zetterburn

As the prince of the Fire Empire, Zetterburn serves his militant nation as a fierce warrior with pride, ferocity, and absolute loyalty.

On the macro scale, Zetterburn is this game’s manifestation of the Space Animal archetype. Spacie players from games like Melee and Project M will find a lot of familiar moves in Zetterburn’s arsenal.

{{< video zetter-spacie >}}

The most obvious twist that Zetterburn introduces to your typical spacie formula is his fire mechanic. A number of Zetterburn’s moves will light the opponent on fire. This fire will deal damage over time for a few seconds.

{{< video zetter-fire >}}

All of Zetterburn’s Strong Attacks are amplified when hitting a flaming opponent, causing these already strong moves to be able to take stocks frighteningly early. He’s well-equipped with ways to set up into these Strongs as well, so this power is always easy to tap into at a moment’s notice.

{{< video zetter-fire-strongs >}}

Zetterburn's advantage state is considered to be particularly explosive and oppressive. He’s also considered to be a rather straightforward character: he doesn’t really have any obtuse gimmicks to learn and his moveset and gameplan are relatively orthodox, making Zetterburn a popular choice for newcomers.

{{< video zetter-punish >}}

His most obvious drawback is his recovery: he has a number of strong ways to mix it up, but it can still be quite a pain point, especially as you’re trying to learn the character. Zetterburn can often find himself in a position where he gets stuck in a loop trying to make it back onto the stage from the edge, especially in certain matchups.

{{< video zetter-recovery >}}

Otherwise, he is considered to be quite well-rounded, and a good Zetterburn player can absolutely succeed in any situation that the game throws at them.

{{< pros "You're a diehard spacie loyalist" "You need access to top-shelf kill power" "You don't want to worry about complex gimmicks or passive abilities" >}}You might like Zetterburn if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "Rinse-and-repeat edgeguards easily frustrate you" "You tend to prefer quirkier characters" "You like having lots of long-range options" >}}You might not like Zetterburn if:{{< /cons >}}

## Orcane

Orcane is a trickster with a reputation for causing trouble. While he's publicly denounced by The Water Merchants, he is often called to their aide to carry out their more back-alley affairs.

His moveset reflects his trickster nature, as he gets a lot of mileage out of conditioning, laying traps, and opportunistic play. His normals have a great combo of good frame data and large hitboxes, allowing him to strike with confidence when an opening presents itself. Complementing this is some of the most readily accessible kill power in the game.

{{< video orcane-intro >}}

He’s able to make these openings with the help of his puddles. Most of his special moves will put a puddle on the ground, which Orcane can use in many ways. He can pop a puddle into a flurry of bubbles which can trap the opponent and grant Orcane a followup, he can consume puddles to dramatically increase the range and damage of his Strong Attacks and Side Special, and he uses puddle for recovery by using Up Special to teleport to it.

{{< video orcane-puddle >}}

Using his great low-commitment pokes in neutral while laying traps with puddles is a deadly combination - once he’s conditioned his opponent to play around his puddle is when Orcane really starts to come into his own.

{{< video orcane-using-specials >}}

That said, while his ability to set up traps and mixups is quite potent, he has no consistent long-range option like a fireball-type projectile or a fast and reliable burst option, so he can struggle to close a distance in some matchups. His long-range presence relies on puddles, which must be planted in advance, and usage of puddles in this way must be balanced with the utility they can offer elsewhere.

{{< video orcane-bubbles >}}

Regardless, Orcane is a slippery scoundrel who has no trouble keeping any opponent on their toes with intelligent play.

{{< pros "You want a combination of great frame data and great hitboxes" "You enjoy being a trickster and setting up traps" "You don't like struggling to take stocks" >}}You might like Orcane if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You want a recovery that doesn't need setup" "You don't want to have to worry about placing and replacing a resource around the stage" "You want consistent options at long-range" >}}You might not like Orcane if:{{< /cons >}}

## Wrastor

An ace fighter of the Air Armada, Wrastor fights under the banner of the Air Nation, earning a reputation for his fighting prowess and bold, loose cannon nature in equal measure.

He is an aerial fighter with high mobility and a nearly unparalleled ability to chase opponents through the skies. He has the most mid-air jumps of any character in the cast, possessing 4 in total. With all of these jumps, his good air control, and his great aerials, he has excellent air juggles and can carry opponents far off the ground with good tracking of positioning and DI.

{{< video wrastor-4-jumps >}}

Further complementing this are his Strong Attacks, which can only be done in the air but serve as great finishers once Wrastor carries his opponent into the skies.

{{< video wrastor-strongs >}}

Wrastor can also set up these juggles quite well in part thanks to his unique ability to jump-cancel his tilts, making them great combo starters.

{{< video wrastor-tilts >}}

His Side Special deploys a Slipstream, which dramatically increases his horizontal speed while he’s inside it.

{{< video wrastor-slipstream >}}

This high speed lets Wrastor excel in an aggressive playstyle where he suffocates his competition or in a defensive playstyle based on using movement to bait and punish with strong burst options to quickly close distance.

{{< video wrastor-juggle >}}

Complementing his speedster status, Wrastor is the lightest character in the game - and very floaty as well - making him an extreme glass cannon.

{{< video wrastor-glass-cannon >}}

Regardless of one’s preferred playstyle, Wrastor excels at punishing bad approach attempts and really commands a strong control over the flow of a match with the looming threat of swooping in in the blink of an eye. Anyone fighting a skilled Wrastor needs to tread carefully or deal with the consequences.

{{< pros "You love long aerial juggles" "You thrive when you can outmaneuver your opponent" "You like to dictate the pace of the game" >}}You might like Wrastor if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You hate being a glass cannon" "You prefer to take stocks on the ground" "You're not great at tracking aerial targets" >}}You might not like Wrastor if:{{< /cons >}}

## Kragg

Kragg is a steadfast member of the Wall Runners: a group dedicated to maintaining The Rock Wall, which protects the Aetherian Forest from the outside world while keeping its wrath contained.

Kragg is arguably the closest thing Rivals has to a traditional platform fighter heavyweight.  He’s built like a brick, having a high weight and fall speed which both grant him high survivability. On the other hand, his mobility is rather low when compared to most of the cast, but not to a degree where he can’t keep up with the pace of most fights.

{{< video kragg-heavyweight >}}

The bruiser that he is, Kragg hits very hard, and one good read can quickly turn the tide of a battle.

{{< video kragg-kill >}}

Despite his larger stature, Kragg’s frame data is pretty solid, and he can certainly hold his own in most close-range engagements.

{{< video kragg-kills >}}

In addition to his strong Normals, Kragg’s Special Moves allow him to play a strong defensive game. His Rock is a great projectile with loads of utility, being able to be thrown at multiple angles or broken apart into a spray of shards.

{{< video kragg-rock>}}

Combined with other parts of his kit like his Down Special, you can consistently stuff the opponent out very well from a distance. His zoning has gaps in the mid-range, but clever play can make this less of a factor.

{{< video kragg-specials >}}

For his Up Special, Kragg summons a rock pillar from below. This offers him a uniquely powerful flexibility in his recovery, but it often leaves him quite vulnerable if it isn’t used with care.

{{< video kragg-pillar >}}

His kit is overall fairly easy to grasp, yet still permits a strong, multifaceted gameplan. Indeed, Kragg’s relatively approachable and consistent kit makes him a common choice for newer players, but there’s still plenty of depth to be had at higher echelons of competition.

{{< pros "You like playing heavies but still want to have solid frame data" "You using seemingly simple tools in creative ways" "You value consistency but can be flexible with your gameplan" >}}You might like Kragg if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You dislike having relatively low mobility" "You dislike having to be really careful in mid-range play" "You hate playing as a fastfaller" >}}You might not like Kragg if:{{< /cons >}}

## Forsburn

The brother of Zetterburn, wrongly framed for the murder of their father, Forsburn has retreated to the shadows in exile and teamed with the rebels of The Smoke Tribe to expose the corruption of The Fire Council.

Forsburn’s kit is a blend of area control and far-reaching pokes with an affinity for deceptive gameplay. He attacks primarily with a dagger and cape, giving him great disjoint and reach on many of his buttons and letting him exercise strong stage control.

{{< video fors-1 >}}

His overall mobility is a bit below average, and he doesn’t have a standard projectile to just toss out in neutral, so good positioning and being able to play patiently when the situation calls for it is particularly important for playing Forsburn effectively.

{{< video fors-2 >}}

The stun of his cape swipes on his Strong Attacks and his many normals that knock the opponent vertically harmonize with his range to let him lock opponents down once he finds an opening and force them into punishing mixups.

{{< video fors-3 >}}

Forsburn’s special moves further bolster his ability to keep opponents guessing. He can set up a smokescreen to conceal his movement and take information away from his opponent, who has to predict where Forsburn will be.

{{< video fors-smoke >}}

Opponents can clear smoke by attacking, but they must be careful not to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, lest Forsburn get the jump on them.

{{< video fors-smoke-2 >}}

He can also create a clone to trick the opponent, and he can pop the clone to create an opening on an opponent who guesses wrong when trying to find the real Forsburn.

{{< video fors-clone >}}

This all comes together to give Forsburn access to some of the trickiest mindgames in the entire game.

{{< video fors-mindgames >}}

Forsburn’s presence is one which breeds obfuscation and uncertainty, and a Forsburn that can play unpredictably is a uniquely threatening foe indeed.

{{< pros "Playing mindgames with your opponent is one of your favorite things to do in fighting games" "You want to use solid disjoint to poke people and lock them down" "You like being hard to pin down" >}}You might like Forsburn if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You don't like slowing things down" "You're not great at masking your intentions" "Not having a standard projectile is a big turn-off" >}}You might not like Forsburn if:{{< /cons >}}

## Maypul

As a Treetop Dweller, Maypul watches over the Aetherian Forest, acting as both a liaison with the surface dwellers and as the watchful protector of the forests below.

Maypul is a speed demon who rewards precision and control. She has the highest ground speed in the game by a fairly large margin.

{{< video maypul-speed >}}

This mobility lets her excel at using positioning to outspace her opponents and she can quickly close gaps between her and other players. She tends to stay grounded, as her aerial frame data is a bit on the slower side and her neutral functions best when she can use grounded movement to quickly reposition.

She has great Normals all around, coming together to form a toolkit that is very fundamentally sound, if a bit weak in terms of directly beating other moves out - but she makes up for that with her speed anyway.

{{< video maypul-grounded >}}

Her down special plants Lily, which hurts anyone who gets too close. Lily is a valuable stage presence - Maypul can use the bite to extend combos or simply put Lily down to control a space.

{{< video maypul-lily >}}

Other special moves will mark the opponent. A marked opponent will be wrapped if hit by Maypul’s strongs or by Lily, allowing Maypul to get all sorts of extended followups.

{{< video maypul-mark >}}

In addition, Maypul can tether to a marked opponent to recover from offstage or extend deep for a punish. Tether confirms are a key part of what makes Maypul’s punish game as deadly as it is, as they allow Maypul to follow up on opponents that are out of reach for most other characters.

{{< video maypul-tether >}}

Much like a Formula 1 racecar, she demands precision from those who pilot her. But, with a skilled driver, it can take a lot to avoid being left in the dust.

{{< pros "You want to be quick on your feet" "You like going for creative combos by ensnaring and tethering to your opponent" "You like rushdown, but are also a fan of laying traps" >}}You might like Maypul if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You prefer to play primarily in the air" "You don't like having to manage a status effect" "You don't enjoy using hit-and-run tactics" >}}You might not like Maypul if:{{< /cons >}}

## Absa

Absa is a renowned scientist who wields the power of thunderstorms to protect her secluded mountaintop society from the wars that rage on the surface below.

She is an explosive character with excellent zoning and incredible kill power. Absa has a toolkit that commands respect at any range and which benefits heavily from conditioning and frustrating the opponent.

{{< video absa-intro >}}

She’s also a glass cannon, boasting some of the most infamous kill moves and kill setups in the game while being quite lightweight and fairly vulnerable once her defenses are breached.

{{< video absa-glass-cannon >}}

Her grounded mobility is pretty average, and her kit isn’t the best for just charging into opponents headfirst. But, her high air speed, low gravity, and excellent recovery options allow her to move about freely in the air, as well as chase opponents deep offstage.

{{< video absa-aerial >}}

Her signature feature is her ability to summon clouds. She can place one at her feet or send them flying forward to pester opponents from a distance.

{{< video absa-cloud >}}

The cloud is a cornerstone for her gameplan, and she can interact with the cloud in many different ways - including popping the cloud to disrupt people in neutral and extend combos, detonating it with aerials to enhance her kicks’ already deadly sweetspots, and she can generate powerful lightning bolts between the cloud and herself.

{{< video absa-using-cloud >}}

Clouds complement her air mobility and Forward Tilt really well to form her strong defensive foundation. Indeed, the mere presence of a cloud commands a lot of respect.

{{< video absa-cloud-threat >}}

Few characters have the ability to erode mental stamina quite like Absa, and her unique blend of defensive gameplay backed by the threat of accessible stock-taking power makes her a good fit for anyone seeking to play with dominance.

{{< pros "You want to command respect from anywhere on the screen" "You enjoy making your opponent work hard to get to you" "You love being able to constantly threaten with a kill" >}}You might like Absa if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You hate being a glass cannon" "Your preferred playstyle is more rushdown oriented" "Floaty, air-focused characters aren't your thing" >}}You might not like Absa if:{{< /cons >}}

## Etalus

Etalus is a warrior hailing from the far northern reaches of Aether. As one of the last surviving members of the elite Harbor Guard, his goal is to destroy the mysterious Black Ice.

Etalus is a big dude who hits like a truck. In many ways, he’s built like a traditional platform fighter heavyweight, but his ice mechanic, which serves as a foundation for many of his strengths, turns a lot of those conventions on their heads.

{{< video etalus-intro >}}

Etalus can lay ice along the ground with a handful of different moves. This ice dramatically lowers his traction, letting him use his wavedash and jump-cancellable dash attack to skate back and forth across the stage at unmatched speeds, making him hard to pin down.

{{< video etalus-ice >}}

Etalus can also consume ice to gain ice armor, making him nigh unkillable until he takes a certain amount of damage or consumes it with another move.

{{< video etalus-armor >}}

That said, while Etalus is a quick and resilient target, he is still a big target and can easily become combo food - particularly offstage thanks to his sometimes quite vulnerable recovery, or if you get caught with ice armor in the wrong situation.

{{< video etalus-disadv >}}

His punish game is very scary, as his high burst mobility makes him great at whiff punishing. Furthermore, he can use Down Special to trap opponents in ice for guaranteed damage in some punish scenarios.

He has excellent edgeguards partly thanks to icicles (Side Special) and his large stature is matched with large hitboxes.

{{< video etalus-punish >}}

Ice does a lot for Etalus, so managing your ice control across the stage can be quite important to get the most out of his kit. That said, he’s no gimmick who relies on ice to be good: his kit is still fundamentally strong and robust.

{{< video etalus-no-ice >}}

When played well, Etalus uses his mobility in conjunction with his other tools to be flexible in his playstyle and command respect over the ground he controls.

{{< pros "You want to be hard to kill" "You like playing heavies but don't want to deal with their typically low mobility" "You love whiff punishing and making it difficult for your opponent to have good spacing" >}}You might like Etalus if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You hate being a big target" "You don't like having to worry about constantly painting the stage with stuff" "You don't want your mobility to be dependent on a resource" >}}You might not like Etalus if:{{< /cons >}}

## Ranno

Ranno is a skilled martial arts master who now guards his homeland, the Swampy Estuary, under a doctrine of pacifism, but his fighting skills are still fearsome and deadly.

Ranno is highly adaptable, straightforward, and consistent - making him quite beginner-friendly. He also has arguably the best frame data in the game, and he can flourish with a high-APM playstyle with how good he is at capitalizing off of any opening he finds. Once he gets an opening, he uses his infamously strong punish routes to obliterate opponents if they are caught in a bad spot.

{{< video ranno-intro >}}

His needles are excellent projectiles for conditioning your opponent and disrupting their actions both onstage and offstage.

{{< video ranno-needles >}}

These needles, along with his Strong Attacks, also apply poison, which deals trace amounts of damage to opponents as they attack.

{{< video ranno-poison >}}

These poison stacks also enhance his tongue command grab, which traps opponents in a bubble for extended combos.

{{< video ranno-tongue >}}

These tools all combine to make his conditioning superb - forcing opponents to respect his quick buttons and punishing their hesitation.

His grounded mobility is pretty good, and he gets a lot out of platform play, but his air speed is rather low so he sometimes has trouble chasing and approaching in the air. Many of his on-stage combos get around this by making using frequent hitfalling to reposition on the ground before continuing his followups in the air.

{{< video ranno-plats >}}

Similarly, he can have trouble landing against a savvy opponent, especially with how low his disjoint tends to be, but his excellent aerials are also great get-off-me tools, so he can keep opponents on their toes.

{{< video ranno-landing >}}

Ranno is a scrappy and accessible character who is versatile enough to fill any role and well-rounded enough to be a commanding presence while doing so.

{{< pros "You want an approachable character with a low skill floor" "You want excellent frame data and the ability to easily hit your way out of a scramble" "You like getting a lot of mileage out of small openings" >}}You might like Ranno if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You don't like having low air speed" "You want plenty of disjoint to work with" "Being able to land is a priority" >}}You might not like Ranno if:{{< /cons >}}

## Clairen

Clairen is a strong-willed time-traveler from a doomed future. Blessed with the lost gift of Fire, she found herself sent back in time to right the wrongs of the future Fire Empire and save her world from a corrupt regime.

She stands as Rivals’s rendition of a swordfighter. Her plasma sword gives her an impressive, disjointed range. You’ll be using long pokes to hit your opponent from a distance most other characters can't easily contest.

{{< video clairen-intro >}}

However, she’s not just a simple fencer: she has a flashy, complex punish game, thanks, in part, to her tipper mechanics. Any tipper will stun the opponent temporarily, granting her access to improved setups and combos.

{{< video clairen-tipper >}}

While she has plenty of tools to build an impressive offense, she can’t just swing recklessly as a lot of her moves have high endlag, leaving her particularly vulnerable to getting whiff punished.

{{< video clairen-whiff-punish >}}

To that end, Clairen can also excel in a more defensive or bait-and-punish-oriented playstyle, carefully using her range to pressure her opponent.

{{< video clairen-playstyle >}}

While her Up Special is pretty large and undoubtedly a bit of a noob-killer, she lacks straightforward recovery mixups and can easily find herself being bullied offstage if she’s caught in a bad spot.

{{< video clairen-recovery >}}

Conversely, however, her edgeguarding is exceptional, using her disjointed pokes and strong setups to give any recovering opponent a real run for their money.

{{< video clairen-edgeguard >}}

She has access to a wide assortment of kill setups, but they’re all quite precise; a good Clairen player needs to stay cognizant of the different situations that she can create and how to respond accordingly to them.

{{< video clairen-kill-confirms >}}

In truth, this situational awareness is key to her success across the board: her kit is overall very flexible and she has a pretty good answer for almost any situation *if* you can stay on your toes and play with keen perception.

{{< pros "You like swordfighters and playing with a range advantage" "You highly value versatility" "You love learning tons of situational kill confirms and being rewarded for it in style" >}}You might like Clairen if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You hate getting whiff punished" "You need to have a projectile" "You don't want to have to work harder than most to get out of edgeguards" >}}You might not like Clairen if:{{< /cons >}}

## Sylvanos

Contained by The Rock Wall, Sylvanos is the rage of the Aetherean Forest given physical form: seeking to endlessly expand the forest after it was scorched by fires and plundered for resources for countless years.

He is a control-focused heavyweight with great keepaway and strong zoning. He’s well equipped to control the stage and force opponents to play around a bevy of strong tools in the mid-range. He has the longest attack range in the game, with an assortment of large and disjointed hitboxes.

{{< video sylv-range >}}

Sylvanos often focuses on playing a very oppressive neutral game, keeping the opponent at a distance such that he can control the pace of the match and avoid letting people get close.

{{< video sylv-spacing >}}

This is almost a necessity, as he can struggle to shake opponents off that breach his defenses thanks to his slow frame data and poor escape options.

{{< video sylv-disadv >}}

Sylvanos combines his long range with his high ground mobility and his passive grass ability to set up a strong stage presence. Grass grows wherever Sylvanos walks, and he uses it in various Special Moves, such as shooting spikes across the grass to cover a large area, chomping through it to extend his Side Special, and giving him a strong hitbox on his burrow recovery.

{{< video sylv-grass >}}

Leaving a grass-covered surface will cause the grass to wither away after a short time unless one of his flowers are planted there, so taking advantage of his strong grounded presence and managing flowers is essential.

{{< video sylv-flowers >}}

Sylvanos can also have a hard time ending stocks, often relying on strict setups or reads for most of his kills. But he makes up for this with his ability to quickly bring opponents to high percents thanks to his exceptional techchase game, allowing a good Sylvanos player to put their opponent in a blender and rack up the damage.

{{< video sylv-killing >}}

Sylvanos is in many ways a character of extremes, but a player who knows how to make the most of his exceptional strengths can become a terrifying threat with a command over the game unlike any other.

{{< pros "You want big buttons with lots of disjoint and the best range in the game" "You play with a focus on area control and dominating the ground with good spacing" "You love putting people in vortexes" >}}You might like Sylvanos if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You dislike having slower frame data" "You want to be able to scramble at point-blank range and easily shake off aggression" "Ample access to kill setups is a must-have" >}}You might not like Sylvanos if:{{< /cons >}}

## Elliana

Elliana hails from the Eastern Wastelands, and once dreamt of flying with the Air Armada. Now, after they rejected her for who she was, she seeks to destroy the Armada out of spite.

Elliana is an aerial zoner with a frightening control of the battlefield and a strong trap-based punish game. She has a destructive advantage state built on setting up aerial juggles.

{{< video elliana-intro >}}

Her mine is a powerful win condition; Elliana’s deadliest punishes center around setting up a mine and following up on opponents caught in its blast.

{{< video elliana-mine >}}

She has tools to open up the opponent from just about anywhere, including steam to ensnare opponents and missiles that she can aim freely.

{{< video elliana-steam-missiles >}}

But she reaps what she sows - she’s one of the biggest pieces of combo food in the entire game, with a massive hurtbox and limited escape options.

{{< video elliana-disadv >}}

Instead of having a standard double jump, Elliana can fly, granting her unique aerial mobility: letting her swoop through the air to both intercept her prey far offstage and hover out of harm’s reach.

{{< video elliana-fly >}}

Elliana’s central mechanic is her heat gauge. She builds up heat by flying and using projectiles (and certain Normals), and releases it by using Strong Attacks or Up Special.

{{< video elliana-heat >}}

When the heat gauge is full, she becomes overheated, where she gains access to very powerful strong attacks at the cost of losing access to her flight and most of her special moves.

{{< video elliana-overheat >}}

Heat management - that is, controlling one’s move usage to be overheated or not overheated at the right moment for the right situation - is a crucial part of any Elliana player’s skill set. For example, her Overheated Strong Attacks are great combo enders, but timing your overheat mid-combo to be able to lead into it can be a difficult balancing act.

{{< video elliana-heat-management >}}

In terms of mechanics and overall game flow, she’s a unique specimen across platform fighters at large and she can be tricky to adjust to for some people. But, dedicated players looking for a unique gameplay experience will be rewarded  splendidly for their efforts.

{{< pros "You want a superb air game backed by unique movement" "You love using deadly setups to win games" "You like having good zoning tools and a strong ranged presence" >}}You might like Elliana if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "Intricate resource management isn't your forté" "You prefer more standard characters with less idiosyncratic playstyles" "You hate being combo food" >}}You might not like Elliana if:{{< /cons >}}

## Ori and Sein

Ori is the first of Rivals of Aether’s guest characters, hailing from Moon Studios’ Ori series.

They are a high-speed character - both in terms of mobility and attacks. Ori excels at keeping the opponent on edge at all times with threatening burst options and slippery movement. Their ground and air speed are both top-shelf, and they generally have the best overall mobility in the game meaning they can outmaneuver just about any other character in most situations and control the pace of a match quite well.

{{< video ori-1 >}}

Ori’s kit is loaded with strong combo tools which flow remarkably well into each other, although often at the cost of range and raw power. At the same time, their quick frame data gives them an edge in close-range fights and they can easily shake off an opponent who gets too greedy. They excel at forcing their opponent into bad situations in order to close out games, which is important given that their raw killpower is somewhat mediocre. However, once the enemy is where Ori wants them, they’ll find themselves being carried into the blastzone or falling victim to a devastating setup.

{{< video ori-2 >}}

Ori is accompanied by Sein. Sein follows behind Ori at all times, copying their movement.

{{< video ori-sein >}}

Sein’s biggest asset is as an option coverage tool, effectively allowing Ori to be in two places at once, making Ori’s edgeguards, techchases, combos, and stage control significantly stronger. Sein has two attacks: quick taps that do a short amount of stun and help Ori extend combos and a charged explosion that is great for setups, edgeguarding, and whiff punishes.

{{< video ori-sein-charge-taps >}}

Together, the two can hold a suffocating control of the stage, provided that their positions are managed effectively. This elusive duo is a tenacious force in the right hands. Fighting with graceful agility, their presence is unrelenting.

{{< pros "You want high mobility and fast buttons" "You like having an oppressive presence in neutral and advantage" "You love being able to cover a lot of options at once" >}}You might like Ori and Sein if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You hate having stubby range" "You don't like having to carry opponents to the blastzone for kills" "Managing the position of yourself and a companion is a turn-off" >}}You might not like Ori and Sein if:{{< /cons >}}

## Shovel Knight

Marking another notch on his already expansive cameo resume, Shovel Knight joins Rivals as Guest Character #2 courtesy of Yacht Club Games.

He is a quirky fighter with a customizable toolkit which snowballs in power throughout the match. He has a lot of unusual and unorthodox moves in his kit, and moreso than most other fighters, his moveset is brimming with nuance that might not be obvious at a glance.

{{< video shovel-intro >}}

Fighting with his shovel and a variety of other weapons, he has good reach and disjoint across his kit, while still having decent frame data. Many of his best moves give him great stage carry, and many of his deadliest combos involve dragging people deep offstage.

{{< video shovel-deep >}}

Shovel Knight truly begins to come into his own once he spends his gems. Gems are a currency acquired throughout a match, spilling out from opponents as they’re hit. He can use these gems to buy relics which grant him new Special Moves or armors which grant passive abilities or buffs to his attributes.

During a typical game, Shovel Knight will only be able to amass enough gems to buy around 2 items of the 6 that are available, so it’s important to choose your purchases carefully based on the current matchup, your opponent’s habits, and the current state of the game.

{{< video shovel-gems >}}

Despite being such a grab-bag of unusual abilities and features, Shovel Knight is relatively well-rounded. He has a little bit of everything: solid frame data, some good disjoint, good mobility options, decent zoning, and great kill power - a real jack-of-all-trades, but a master of none.

{{< video shovel-kills >}}

There’s a little bit of something here for everyone, and players looking to be as adaptive and flexible as possible would probably *dig* this member of the roster.

{{< pros "You enjoy being able to customize your moveset mid-match to suit your needs" "You love combos that carry the opponent to the blastzone" "You enjoy pulling crazy gimmicks out of nowhere in the middle of a game" >}}You might like Shovel Knight if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You don't like having to build resources to reach your full power" "You don't want to worry about gathering collectables during a match" "You dislike being a jack of all trades but a master of none" >}}You might not like Shovel Knight if:{{< /cons >}}

## Mollo

Mollo uses various bombs to pester opponents from a distance and for creative setup-based gameplay. He can pull bombs and then throw them, or hit bombs dropped on the ground with a variety of different moves to keep opponents on their toes with different trajectories and timings.

{{< video mollo-intro >}}

Each of his bomb types have unique effects: he’ll be using different bombs depending on what your current goal is, whether that’s knocking the opponent around, controlling space, building up damage, or closing out stocks.

{{< video mollo-bombs >}}

Mollo particularly rewards good awareness and creativity with using different bombs in clever situations. There’s plenty to unpack with Mollo’s bombs, so some lab time and a strong working knowledge of different setups can be especially beneficial.

{{< video mollo-using-bombs>}}

Mollo’s bombs may be his headlining feature, but he’s more than just a projectile spammer as he has a solid close-to-mid range presence as well. His decent buttons let him keep up the pressure when things get scrappy and he can discourage the opponent from disrespectfully charging in through bombs by making them think twice about how to approach him.

{{< video mollo-melee >}}

Mollo is a character whose potential is only going to grow as time goes on as more bomb setups are developed and the strategies around each bomb type grow more complex. So if you want a lot to chew on, Mollo might be just what you're looking for.

{{< pros "You love creative projectile-based setups" "You like to frustrate your opponent with long-range zoning" "You want to throw projectiles and throw hands in equal measure" >}}You might like Mollo if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You don't like having to plan far ahead when zoning" "You want to minimize your time spent in training mode" "You only want to play like a bruiser" >}}You might not like Mollo if:{{< /cons >}}

## Hodan

On a surface level, Hodan’s a fairly traditional platform fighter heavyweight in many ways: being hard to kill, having big moves that hit hard, and getting especially strong returns on hard reads.

{{< video hodan-intro >}}

However, Hodan has the unique distinction of being a charge character in a platform fighter. He can build a charge by pressing and holding any downward directional input, and the charge will stay until shortly after down is released.

{{< video hodan-charge >}}

Charging lets Hodan enhance many of his moves or grant them special properties. For example, Charged Forward Air is much larger than its uncharged version, and charged Side Special travels faster and goes at a different trajectory.

{{< video hodan-charge-moves >}}

Maintaining a charge in the thick of a fight can be a bit tricky, especially when trying to move or react for DI, so it takes some care to find time to charge and keep it stored.

{{< video hodan-using-charge >}}

He can also interact with the sweat spirits he places with Side Special to enhance other attacks. Charge and sweat spirit enhancements give Hodan’s kit a lot of diversity and flexibility.

{{< video hodan-spirits >}}

His strongest moves can be especially committal, but can lead to damaging openings or an early stock if Hodan makes the right response or callout for a situation, particularly if the opponent is caught above Hodan at a bad time.

{{< video hodan-kills >}}

A skilled player can take advantage of this and formulate a solid gameplan around conditioning their opponent to avoid these situations and applying pressure to combat attempts to play around them.

{{< pros "You're a big fan of Smash Bros' heavyweight playstyle" "You enjoy having your dexterity and awareness rewarded in direct ways" "You love exploiting your opponent's habits" >}}You might like Hodan if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You don't like characters with unusual input requirements" "You don't have much trigger discipline with your strongest moves" "You always want to be holding forward" >}}You might not like Hodan if:{{< /cons >}}

## Pomme

Pomme creates a strong presence in the air with her unique mobility centered around her float. Much like similar mechanics from other platform fighters, holding Jump while falling or pressing down lets Pomme float at a fixed height while maintaining some horizontal air control.

{{< video pomme-float >}}

This lets her do things like mix up her landing timing, hover outside of harm’s reach, and easily access her aerials while close to the ground.

{{< video pomme-using-float >}}

If she’s inside her harmonic field, which she can place with Down Special, her air control improves greatly while floating and she can also drift up and down, giving her even more movement tricks.

{{< video pomme-note-field >}}

She can be a pretty mechanically intensive character if you want to get the most out of the advanced movement that float opens up for her, but she’s got solid fundamentals that any skilled player can tap into.

{{< video pomme-advanced >}}

She has many attacks with great frame data, loads of clever ways to extend combos, and the ability to apply strong pressure in close-to-mid range, but her long range presence is relatively lacking.

Like most other Air characters, she’s light and floaty, so mistakes can spell an early death if you’re not careful.

{{< video pomme-light >}}

This superstar’s more than just a pretty face; while her floaty tricks might give a very particular first impression for those coming from Smash, she's got plenty of unique quirks going on behind the curtain and can truly sing a tune of her own.

{{< pros "You love using unique and technical movement options" "You want great combo tools with a strong presence when things get scrappy" "You want to have unique access to your aerial options and use them in clever ways" >}}You might like Pomme if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You hate getting killed early" "Being in the air makes you antsy" "You need low-commitment options for ranged play" >}}You might not like Pomme if:{{< /cons >}}

## Olympia

Olympia is a brawler with chunky attacks and a scary advantage state. Out of the four latest additions to the cast, she’s definitely the most straightforward. She’s an in-your-face martial artist who rewards strong offensive, rushdown-oriented gameplay.

{{< video olympia-intro >}}

Despite her average size, she hits like a bulldozer and feels more like a heavyweight - that is, she’s on the heavier, slower end of the cast. Fortunately, Olympia has some clever movement tricks with Down Special Focus Cancels and her Side Special dashes, letting her bob and weave unpredictably despite a slower raw speed.

{{< video olympia-movement >}}

When she gets an opening, Olympia has a particularly potent punish game, able to dish out flurries of blows with relative ease. Her great kill moves are matched with solid setups to ensure that she has no trouble closing out games. Furthermore, her Neutral Special and Down Special let her put opponents in a crystallized stun state, giving her even crazier combos.

{{< video olympia-combos >}}

Her Neutral Special acts as a stage control tool with the looming threat of crystalizing the opponent if they wander into the crystal’s field unprepared, while also letting her jump cancel her Side Special if she is inside it to catapult herself forward.

{{< video olympia-field-stage-control >}}

If your top priority is letting loose with some punches and kicks and being as direct with your beatdown as possible, then Olympia would be a brilliant choice.

{{< pros "You don't want to have any troubles taking stocks when you have the chance to" "You want a straightforward and accessible kit" "You like setting up a 'danger zone' that your opponent has to respond to" >}}You might like Olympia if:{{< /pros >}}
{{< cons "You don't like having low base mobility" "You prefer a more keepaway-oriented playstyle" "You don't like relying on burst options to close distance or overcome good zoning" >}}You might not like Olympia if:{{< /cons >}}

Now, you should have a better idea of what to expect from Rivals of Aether’s roster and hopefully have some guidance on who you might want to play.
