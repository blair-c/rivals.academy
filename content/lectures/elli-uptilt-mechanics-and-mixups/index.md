## The Basics

Up Tilt is a move with relatively weak knockback at its base, but built-up heat can be expended to empower the move. Up Tilt’s knockback increases linearly based on how much heat is expended, from 7 base + 60 scaling with no heat to 9 base + 90 scaling at overheat, and its endlag on hit from 10 frames with no heat to 20 frames at overheat.

Up Tilt is a move with a multitude of mixups, but even without them the move is still very powerful. Overheat Up Tilt can kill confirm into Missile > Nair or almost any of Elli’s other deadly combos, or just outright kill. However, there are certain percent windows (which vary greatly depending on stage, character, and positioning) where a high heat Up Tilt may not be easy to convert off of while not killing outright either, and this is where our mixups become especially useful.

## Mixups

### Heat Retain

By holding the parry button as you release the opponent, you can retain all heat, and consequently lower the move’s knockback and endlag significantly (depending on how much heat you currently have). **This is a completely unreactable DI mixup.**

Once your opponent hits mid percents, they typically have no choice but to DI in on high heat Up Tilt at ledge unless they make a hard read on your heat retain, which is a risk immensely stacked in your favour (especially since if they read you correctly and DI out, they’re still offstage versus one of the best edgeguarders in the game). As such, it ends up being very easy to confirm heat retain Up Tilt into an overheat strong attack, and depending on the percent any of the three strongs can be applied. This can net you kills in situations where you may not otherwise be able to secure the stock.

### Turnaround

Additionally, Up Tilt can be turned around by inputting the opposite direction before the opponent is swallowed by Elli’s mech. **This is a reactable DI mixup, with a 23 frame animation.**

While not nearly as potent a mixup, turning around your Up Tilt to send the opponent to the opposite side of the stage can also function as a lethal DI check and keep your opponent on their toes.

Once you start implementing Up Tilt’s multi-tiered mixups, you’ll be frustrating your opponents to no end! (even more than you were already)
