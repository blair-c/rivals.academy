Monkey copter is a pivotal and thankfully easy tech for Hodan that allows him to gain a lot of vertical height while using Neutral Special, at the cost of some time to set it up and his double jump.

## How To

In order to do the monkey copter you first must have used Neutral Special at any point during your current air time. Then, use jump, Neutral Special, and press down on the joystick. This should result in a massive increase in height.

Be careful with when you press down so you don’t accidentally get Down Special. The down input needs to be delayed a bit until after you press Neutral Special.

## Application

Monkey copter’s primary application is as a recovery tool. Some examples of things it can be used for are as follows:

You can use it to recover directly to stage.

Or recover high with it.

And it can be even better if combined with sweat spirits.

Do keep in mind that this is still monkey spin, so you can still go dizzy.

Monkey copter is fairly easy and definitely something any Hodan should add to their repertoire. So go out and soar into the skies!
